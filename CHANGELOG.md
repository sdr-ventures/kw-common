# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

A breaking change to a name in a module's `__all__` is a MAJOR bump, and its entry names every
exported symbol that changed. ⛔ It does NOT name the consumers that need a code change: this
repository is public, and honouring that older promise would publish the fleet's inventory at
exactly the moment the release notes are read most widely.

## [1.7.1] - Unreleased

**Closes the gaps the first seven adoptions of the 1.7.0 leak guard found.** No name in any
module's `__all__` was removed or changed in signature, and a consumer on `v1.7.0` changes no
input to bump — PATCH.

### Fixes

* The reusable `leak-guard.yml` job carries `timeout-minutes: 30`. A caller cannot set one on a job
  that calls a reusable workflow, so every consumer's check ran to GitHub's six-hour default when
  git or pip hung.
* A revision range, ref or remote name an OPERATOR typed is redacted exhaustively before it is
  printed. A shape butted against `.`, `..`, `_`, `:` or a digit (`main..<addr>`, `ref:<ipv6>`) was
  refused by the patterns' own boundaries and echoed intact. A string over 200 characters is
  withheld rather than echoed. Findings about repository content are unchanged.
* `--check-hooks` runs each hook's own command line (`python -I -m kw_common.leakguard
  --pre-commit` / `--pre-push`, plus the new `--probe`, which answers without reading a repository)
  instead of importing the module. An interpreter whose installed engine predates the hook flags,
  or cannot run the module as `__main__`, imported cleanly and was reported active while git
  refused every commit. `--probe` is a modifier of `--pre-commit` / `--pre-push` only; an engine
  older than 1.7.1 rejects it, which `--check-hooks` reports as inactive.
* When a tag, a new branch or a manual run has nothing to scan from, the reusable workflow still
  scans everything reachable (never an empty range read as clean) and now says so in the log.
  `ci.yml`'s range step is the reusable workflow's, byte for byte: a new branch is scanned from the
  default branch instead of its tip only.
* `v<version>rc0` (and `rc00`, `RC1`) is refused by `release.yml` and publishes nothing; this was
  already so in 1.7.0 and is now pinned by a test.

### Documentation

* `docs/ADOPTION.md`: the verification block compares with `origin/<base>` (the PR's base branch —
  the integration branch of a two-environment repository), not `origin/main`; hooks are installed
  from a virtual environment outside every worktree and any session scratch directory;
  `git config --unset core.hooksPath` is one repository-wide setting that changes the shared
  checkout and every worktree; the first `v*` tag and the default branch's first push scan the
  whole history; the project-side check for private literals is a separate layer the pin's hooks do
  not run; `.leakguard.json` is created only when a legitimate value trips a shape.
* The 1.7.0 entry below was headed "Unreleased" after `v1.7.0` was cut.

### Tests

* Issue #6 (the v1.0.0 mutation survivors). Re-measured on 1.7.0: 34 of 41 mutations were already
  caught. Now also pinned: a commented-out setting taking effect (item 10, which the earlier note
  called pinned but only an incidental template test caught), the rollback's no-op write (2), each
  `previous` guard alone (3), `notify`'s own opt-out gate (4), and the `makedirs`/`os.open` modes
  that stand when `chmod` fails (1, POSIX only). Left unpinned on purpose: the blank-line skip in
  `read_jsonl_tail` (8), which the broad `except` below it makes unobservable.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-10-09

**Makes the leak guard correct enough to be the one engine the fleet runs.** No name in any
module's `__all__` was removed or changed in signature — MINOR.

### Behaviour that changes what a scan reports

* **Two new shapes** (consumer#245). `private IPv6 (ULA / link-local)` — unique-local (fc00/7) and
  link-local (fe80/10) addresses, written in full or `::`-elided, bare or in a URL's brackets.
  `home network domain (RFC 8375)` — a host under `.home.arpa`. Both apply to file content, paths,
  commit messages and tags. RFC 3849's `2001:db8::/32` is the documented IPv6 placeholder and does
  not fire; neither do the range bases written as ranges. A repository whose tests carry a
  link-local or zero-ID unique-local literal will see a finding on bump: rewrite it to the RFC
  3849 prefix.
* **A finding no longer prints the matched value** — only the shape, the file and the line. Any
  printed path, revision range or directory has its shapes redacted to `<label>`. The value used to
  be republished in every CI log that reported it. Exit codes are unchanged.
* Control bytes other than the newline are escaped in printed output, so an ESC or CR in a decoded
  filename cannot overwrite a finding line. A newline in a filename still starts a new line.

A `.gitignore` glob whose `*` follows `.local`/`.lan` directly is still a finding (consumer#237):
Markdown emphasis around a real host is the same string. Allow the literal in `.leakguard.json`.

### Fixes

* `#31` — a file with a `working-tree-encoding` attribute is checked out NUL-bearing by design,
  and a clean tree was refused as "not UTF-8 text". The tree scan now reads the index blob for it,
  as the unraid-templates guard does; without the attribute the refusal stands.
* unraid-templates#37 — a path holding a quote, a backslash or a control byte is C-quoted in the
  `diff --git` header whatever `core.quotePath` says, and the range and staged scans refused every
  such file. The header is decoded now; only a malformed header is still refused.
* consumer#239 — the tree scan read each staged-but-absent file with its own `git cat-file`
  (~74 ms each). They are read in one batch, by the index's blob SHA.
* `is_shallow` treated a git that could not answer as a complete clone; anything but `false` is now
  shallow, so the range scan refuses rather than scanning truncated history.
* `#37` — the release workflow refused a `vX.Y.ZrcN` tag. It now publishes one as a pre-release
  of `X.Y.Z`; any other tag must still equal `v<__version__>`.

### Distribution: adopting is a pin, not a copy

* **A reusable workflow**, `.github/workflows/leak-guard.yml` (`workflow_call`, input `version`):
  the self-test, the tree scan and the range scan of what the event publishes — for a tag, the
  commits since the previous `v[0-9]*` tag and the tag object; for a new branch, everything the
  default branch does not have. One job id gives every repository the same required check:
  `leak-guard / No internal info (leak guard)`.
* **Hooks the package installs** (`#17`): `kw-leak-guard --install-hooks` writes a pre-commit and a
  pre-push shim into the git directory, where no checkout removes them; `--check-hooks` says
  whether git will run them; `--pre-commit` and `--pre-push <remote>` are what they call. A shim
  whose interpreter is gone fails rather than skipping; it runs isolated (`-I`), so a repository
  cannot shadow the guard with its own `kw_common/`; an empty `core.hooksPath` is refused; a push
  of a tag on a blob or tree is refused. This repository's own pre-push hook is now
  installed the same way (copied into the git directory), not through a relative
  `core.hooksPath`.
* **A tag range no longer re-reads the previous release's annotation.** `release.yml` and the
  reusable workflow name the base tag peeled to its commit; the guard reads a tag object for every
  revision a range names, base included.
* **`docs/ADOPTION.md`**: the migration for a Python service, a container, a template repository
  and a vendored copy of the guard, and the checks that prove it worked.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-10-08

**Stops ntfy dropping a long alert** (`#36`). ntfy answers HTTP 400 to a message body of about
4096 bytes or more and to a title of about 1000 bytes, so an alert with a long traceback or title
never reached the phone (email was unaffected). `_post_ntfy` now caps the message at 3000 bytes and
the `[SEV] <title>` at 540 bytes (732 bytes once RFC 2047-encoded), cutting at a character boundary
and ending with `…[truncated]`. Anything within the bound is sent unchanged. No name in `__all__`
changed — PATCH.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-10-02

**Fixes ntfy alerts arriving as raw JSON with no title** (`#34`). Every ntfy alert sent by
**v1.6.1** shows on the phone as one block of text beginning `{"title": "...", "message": "..."}`
with the backslash-n escapes visible, and the notification title is only the topic name. ntfy interprets
a JSON body only when it is published to the server root with a `topic` field; posted to a topic
URL, the body is the message verbatim. The title now travels as an RFC 2047 encoded-word `Title`
header (pure ASCII, so it can carry any text, including characters outside latin-1 such as an
em-dash — `#32` does not regress) and the message is the plain UTF-8 body. `Priority`/`Tags` are
unchanged. No name in `__all__` changed — PATCH.

### Which tags are affected, and what to bump to

* **v1.6.1 — affected.** Bump to **v1.6.2**.
* **v1.6.0 and earlier — not affected by the raw-JSON display**, but an alert whose title carries a
  character outside latin-1 is never sent (`#32`, `UnicodeEncodeError`). Bumping to **v1.6.2**
  fixes that too.

### Behaviour to know

* ntfy trims leading and trailing whitespace from the message body; that is the server's behaviour.
* ntfy answers 400 to a message body of about 4096 bytes or more (and to a very long title), so
  such an alert is still not delivered by the ntfy channel. Unchanged by this release.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-09-16

**Fixes the ntfy channel dropping an alert whose title carries a character outside latin-1** (an
em-dash, an arrow — the fleet's own message-punctuation conventions), `#32`. `notify()` raised
`UnicodeEncodeError` INSIDE the ntfy channel before the request was ever sent, logged at WARNING
in the same log nobody watches when the alert was supposed to page them; email was unaffected
(MIME handles UTF-8). Title and message now travel in the ntfy JSON body instead of an HTTP
header — the body is UTF-8 and has no such limit. `Priority`/`Tags` are unaffected. No name in
`__all__` changed — this is a bug fix to existing exported behaviour, PATCH per this project's own
semver contract.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-12

**Closes the three scan-coverage holes v1.5.0's own gate found in itself** (`#26`, `#27`, `#28`),
plus the root question behind all three: why a tree scan, a range scan and a `--staged` scan could
reach different verdicts on the same bytes. No name in `__all__` changed — this is additive.

### ⚠️ WHAT A CONSUMER SHOULD EXPECT WHEN IT BUMPS

**New findings, again, are the fix working.** A leak that was invisible to every scan before this
release may now be caught — that is what closing these three holes means.

* **`#26` — a binary suffix plus one NUL inside git's 8000-byte window no longer earns a silent
  pass by itself.** `deploy-notes.pdf = b"\x00\nsecret host <addr> lives here\n..."` used to scan
  clean in every mode; the name's binary claim is now trusted in silence only when the bytes ALSO
  fail a strict UTF-8 decode. A NUL is itself valid UTF-8, which is exactly what made the old
  NUL-only test unable to tell a planted leak from a real asset. **Narrowed residual, not zero**:
  a leak sharing a file with one genuinely non-UTF-8 byte (not the NUL itself) still corroborates
  the binary claim and is still skipped in silence — stated in KNOWN LIMITS rather than chased,
  because closing it fully means either false-redding every binary asset in a repository or
  reading every asset's decodable byte-runs (its own false-positive risk on files nobody can
  edit).
* **`#27` — the range and `--staged` scans now DISCLOSE a NUL-bearing line the same way the tree
  scan always has.** A hinted file with some lines dropped for a NUL (and its other lines
  genuinely scanned) used to clear silently on these two surfaces; both now print the same
  "PARTLY read" block the tree scan prints, naming the file and how many lines it could not read.
  This is disclosure, not a new failure mode: a NON-hinted path with a NUL-bearing line is
  unchanged and still fails closed (`#242`'s posture).
* **`#28` — a clean latin-1 file at an ordinary path no longer blocks `git commit` while `--push`
  clears the identical bytes.** Every path now decodes with `errors="replace"`, matching how the
  range/`--staged` scans have always read the same bytes — a real leak is still caught (every
  pattern is ASCII; a replacement character cannot forge a match), and a leak-free latin-1 file no
  longer has to be renamed under an asset suffix to pass. Measured identical on `v1.4.1` and
  `v1.5.0`; this was not introduced by either.

### Why the three scans used to disagree

One list, `ParsedDiff.unscannable`, used to carry two genuinely different answers: "git refused
this outright, I cannot vouch for any of it" and "one added line carried a NUL, the rest of this
file was scanned." The tree scan had always kept those as two separate questions (`Reading.
unreadable` vs. `Reading.partial`); the range and `--staged` scans had only one, which is what let
the disclosure gap in `#27` open. `ParsedDiff` now carries a third field, `partial`, so the same
split applies everywhere: `unscannable` is a scan's fail-closed refusal, `partial` is its
disclosure of the SAME kind the tree scan already had a word for.

### `#6` — left open, unchanged

Assessed again against this release; the two residual mutation survivors are unpinnable **by
construction** (documented redundancy, not untested behaviour), the same finding v1.5.0 recorded.
No new evidence to close it with.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-06

**This release is a migration brief as much as a changelog.** Five repositories still carry their
own copy of the leak guard, and the scan-coverage defects a sibling fixed in ITS copy are fixed
here instead — so the fleet gets them by moving a pin rather than by five hand-ports that each get
a chance to diverge. Six library-side defects the first adopter could only work around are fixed
with them.

### ⚠️ WHAT A CONSUMER SHOULD EXPECT WHEN IT BUMPS

**New findings are the fix working, not a regression.** Three of the changes below make a scan
read something it previously skipped, so a repository whose tree scanned clean on 1.4.1 may
scan RED on 1.5.0 — a plain-text file wearing an asset's name, a leak on a readable line of a
file that carries a NUL further in. That is a leak that was always there and was never read.
Fix the value; do not reach for an allowance.

**And two changes make a scan STOP reddening a tree that is correct.** A repository whose tracked
files are all genuine assets — an icon set, a fonts package — was refused by 1.4.1 with "ZERO were
read as text" and no remedy its operator could apply. And a repository that keeps a file named
after a commit sha at its root (a `format-patch` scratch file, a `git show <sha> > <sha>` dump)
had its whole `--range` scan die `exited 128`, printing a remedy for a cause that had nothing to
do with it. Both pass now.

**Two boot-time refusals are new**, and this is the one to read carefully because of WHAT it does
and WHEN it lands.
* *What:* both are refusals in `email_ready()` / `ntfy_ready()`, so `warn_if_unconfigured` reports
  the channel down immediately — and `alerting_env.validate_boot*` RAISES `AlertEnvError`, which
  the setup document tells adopters to let stop the process. So this is not only "a channel is
  disabled": a service configured either way **does not start**.
* *When:* **on the first boot after the bump, for every service.** ⚠️ This is the one paragraph
  that changed late and it changed in the safer direction, so read it rather than skimming it.
  1.4.1's new refusal was met LATER — `validate_boot` returns early while the marker records the
  current config's digest, so a deployment whose `configs/alerting.env` was untouched skipped
  re-validation and met the refusal at some unrelated later moment. The marker now records the
  SERVICE as well (#18, below), so no marker written before 1.5.0 matches: every service
  re-validates exactly once on its first boot after the bump, and that is where both refusals
  land. A migration that fails is far better than one that fails three months later looking
  like something else — but it means **the bump itself is when to be watching**, not the next
  config edit. Roll one service first.
* *Which:* an `EMAIL_FROM` that normalises to nothing (`";"`), and an ntfy URL with something
  before the `[` of a bracketed IPv6 host — the shape `urlsplit`'s IPv6 hardening was the only
  thing refusing, on the interpreters that have it. Real userinfo (`user:pass@[::1]`) was already
  refused by an older branch and is not what changed.
* *Cost:* a deployment relying on either was not delivering. ⚠️ Stated exactly rather than
  absolutely: an `EMAIL_FROM` of `";"` produces a NULL return-path, which **most** submission
  servers refuse — a relay that accepts one was delivering, and for that deployment this is a
  behaviour change rather than a fix. Nothing else that was delivering stops.

**One re-validation and one confirmation alert per service, once.** The marker's contents grew a
line, so every marker an earlier release wrote is now unmatched — which costs exactly one
validation and one announcement per service, then silence. That alert reaches every channel the
service has configured, so an operator upgrading the fleet should expect one email and one push
per service rather than none. It is the same migration 1.3.0 made when the marker stopped being
empty, and it needs no operator step.

⚠️ **Rolling BACK costs the same, and the first draft of this section said it cost nothing.**
Line one is still `sha256:<hex>`, so anything reading the FIRST LINE reads the digest — but the
only reader that exists is this library's own, and 1.3.0–1.4.1 compares the marker's WHOLE text
to a bare digest, which a two-line marker cannot equal. Measured, not reasoned about. So a
rollback re-validates and re-announces once per service, exactly as the upgrade does. Cheap and
symmetric, but a cost rather than the absence of one.

⛔ **Check that no two services share a `CONFIG_PATH` before you bump.** That has always been
against the rule — `marker_dir` is documented as the app's OWN read-write directory — and the
COST of breaking it changed here. It used to be quiet and wrong: the second service skipped
validation on the first service's marker, so its own service-derived settings were never
checked, which is #18 arriving from the other side. It is now loud: each service overwrites the
other's record, so both re-validate and both announce on EVERY boot — measured at four alerts
per boot for two services. Nothing in the library can tell that apart from a legitimate rename,
which produces the identical marker state and must re-validate, so the behaviour is the same for
both and the process log is what separates them: a warning is logged when a boot REPLACES a
different service's record, so **a line that appears on every boot is a shared directory and one
that appears once is a rename.** A boot that writes no marker — no `Alerter` installed, or a
refusal — logs nothing, because it has taken nothing from anybody.

**Nothing in any module's `__all__` was removed or renamed.** Four names were added.

**Unchanged, and worth knowing if you have a large tracked asset:** the tree scan reads every
tracked file's bytes before deciding anything, so peak memory is about twice the largest tracked
file. That is not new — 1.4.1 does the same, measured — and the suffix list still avoids the read
in the range and `--staged` scans. It is mentioned only so nobody attributes it to this release.

### Added

- **`AlertSettings(logger_name=...)`, and `load_alert_settings(..., logger_name=...)` /
  `load_alert_settings_from_env(..., logger_name=...)`.** A logger NAME is an operator-facing
  surface — a per-logger level, a filter, a shipper's routing are all written against it — so a
  service that has always emitted its alerting records on its own name could not adopt this
  library without silently relocating every one of them. The first adopter kept its name by
  REBINDING this module's `log` global: correct for one consumer in one process, and
  last-writer-wins the moment there are two. It is injected configuration now, like everything
  else. `""` (the default) means this module's own logger, and it is inert for every existing
  caller. ⚠️ A blank or non-string name means the module's logger and never the ROOT one —
  `logging.getLogger("")` IS the root, which is what an unset container Variable would have
  produced.
- **Four pure helpers are exported and under semver: `recipients`, `parse_env_file`,
  `escalate_gap_hours`, `is_cert_failure`.** The first adopter imported all four by their
  `_`-prefixed spellings because its own suite tested them directly, so four behaviours a
  consumer depends on sat outside the contract and any rename would have been a surprise at
  runtime rather than a red build. The `_`-prefixed spellings survive as ALIASES of the same
  objects, so existing imports keep working; they are not themselves promised. `_CHANNELS` and
  `_now` are deliberately NOT exported — one is a private structure a consumer should not read,
  the other a test seam.
- **`parse_env_file(..., logger=...)` and `read_jsonl_tail(..., logger=...)`**, both keyword-only
  (`read_jsonl_tail`'s was not, until the verification gate read this line against the signature
  and found the claim false), so
  the two module-level functions that log can be told where. Positional shapes are unchanged.

### Fixed — the leak guard reads what it claimed to read

- **The TREE scan missed a leak that `--range` and `--staged` both caught.** Its binary test asked
  "is there a NUL ANYWHERE, or does this fail to decode"; git asks "is there a NUL in the first
  8000 bytes". So a file named `.pdf` holding 9 KB of plain ASCII with one NUL at the end was
  served as TEXT by git — reported by the range and staged scans, and SKIPPED WHOLE by the tree
  scan, which is the layer a pre-commit hook runs and the one that runs most often. Measured on
  1.4.1: `--staged` and `--range` exit 1 naming the line, tree scan exit 0, "1 tracked text files
  scanned". The window is git's own now, so all three classify a file the same way. A NUL-bearing
  LINE in such a file is blanked rather than removed, so a finding after it keeps its true line
  number, and the tree scan discloses the partial read (`PARTLY read`) instead of counting the
  file as fully scanned.
- **A latin-1 file under an asset's name is scanned rather than skipped in silence.** A failed
  UTF-8 decode was treated as "binary", but git serves such a file as text and the range scan has
  always scanned it with replacement characters — so a latin-1 runbook named `.pdf` was reported
  by `--range` and cleared by the tree scan. Same file, same verdict, from every scan.
- **`--staged` no longer resolves one file's name to another file's bytes.** It asked git for
  `:<path>`, which is a REVISION expression in which `:0:`/`:1:`/`:2:`/`:3:` name a merge STAGE —
  so a path beginning with one of those prefixes was vouched for by a DIFFERENT file's content and
  the scan reported clean. It asks for `:0:<path>` now, which makes the remainder unambiguously a
  path. (Not reachable on Windows, where git refuses a colon in a filename, which is exactly why
  it had to be ported rather than waited for.)
- **Anything named `HEAD` beside the repository root no longer kills a scan with a traceback.**
  git resolves a revision NAME against the filesystem as well as the refs, so a file, an untracked
  file or a DIRECTORY of that name produced `fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD'`, exit 128 — and
  `--staged` died with a stack trace naming an argument the operator never typed. Every diff and
  every `rev-list` this engine runs now carries the `--` separator.
- **The zero-file floor is RETIRED, and that is a repair rather than a removal.** It refused any
  tree with tracked files where none was read as text — written for the `.pdf`-of-ASCII case,
  which the change above now READS. What it was left catching was a repository of nothing but
  genuine assets: a correct tree, reddened, with "add a README" as the only remedy, which is
  precisely how a guard gets switched off. Every tracked PATH is scanned, so such a run has not
  looked at nothing, and the verdict says so: `no internal info found (N tracked text files
  scanned, M tracked path(s) examined)`. ⚠️ **Two success lines changed wording** — that one, and
  the empty-tree verdict, which is a different string with a semicolon and no `examined` count
  (`no internal info found (0 tracked text files scanned; <root> has no tracked files at all -
  check --repo if that is a surprise)`). Anything matching on either needs updating. The empty
  tree still passes (`git commit --allow-empty` is how a repository is started), which is the one
  decision here taken differently from the sibling's.
- **A file named after a commit sha no longer kills the range scan.** `commit_identity` and
  `commit_message` run `git show -s --format=… <sha>`, and git resolves a revision against the
  FILESYSTEM as well as the refs — so one file of that name at the root, tracked or not, produced
  `exited 128` and the scan printed "Fetch the base ref", a remedy for something else entirely.
  The comment justifying the separator elsewhere claimed a full sha could not collide, which is
  what left these two calls uncovered; every git call here that takes a revision carries `--` now.

### Fixed — alerting

- **`email_ready()` asks `EMAIL_FROM` the question it already asked `EMAIL_TO`.** A
  separators-only value is non-empty, so it passed the presence check — and `smtplib` derives the
  ENVELOPE SENDER from that header, which for `;` is the empty string. Most submission servers
  refuse a null return-path, so every send failed while the boot line said "email + ntfy ready".
  The two halves of one hand-edited file were held to different rules. ⚠️ **A new boot refusal**,
  for a configuration that was not delivering. Two addresses in `EMAIL_FROM` still truncate to the
  first and deliver, which is a misconfiguration with a reasonable outcome and is left alone.
- **A refused `SMTP_PORT` complains once per DISTINCT VALUE — per config file, per logger — rather
  than once per send.** The config is re-read on every delivered notification, deliberately, so a
  rotated password takes effect without a restart; one mistyped port therefore produced one
  identical ERROR line per alert, forever. Measured: 5 calls, 5 lines. A value corrected and then
  re-broken complains afresh, so a real recurrence is not swallowed, and the boot report
  (`setting_faults()`) carries the fault regardless. ⚠️ Two services in one process share the
  fleet's single `alerting.env`, so they share the FAULT — the logger is part of the key precisely
  so each service's own operator is told once, rather than the first one to ask taking the only
  line. On the fleet's shape that means N services, N lines, then silence.
- **A failed email send no longer logs the RECIPIENT ADDRESS verbatim.** `SMTPRecipientsRefused`
  carries the recipient dict in its `str()`, so a broken channel printed the address on every
  alert — in the log an operator is told to fetch and paste into an issue, and in exactly the
  shape this package's own leak guard exists to catch. The resolved `EMAIL_TO`/`EMAIL_FROM`
  addresses join the redaction set, in both the header form an operator typed and the bare form an
  exception quotes. `SMTP_USER` stays out, documented unsecret: it is often a bare word such as
  `apikey`, and redacting that from every diagnostic is pure cost.
- **`ntfy_ready()` refuses a bracketed IPv6 host carrying userinfo on EVERY interpreter (#8).**
  That URL was refused only because `urlsplit` raises `Invalid IPv6 URL`, and that check shipped
  in CPython PATCH releases — which `requires-python = ">=3.10"` does not constrain. Measured:
  present on 3.10.20 and 3.14.7, absent on 3.12.0, where the channel reported READY and was dead
  on every send. The refusal mirrors the stdlib's own rule rather than adding a fourth
  hand-written host-shape predicate, so the two cannot disagree about a URL. ⚠️ A new boot
  refusal on the interpreters that lacked the check; an ordinary `https://[::1]/topic` is
  unaffected.
- **The validation marker records the SERVICE that validated, not only the config and the
  environment (#18).** `_check_usable` validates settings DERIVED FROM THE SERVICE NAME — the ntfy
  key it looks up, and the title prefix that becomes an HTTP header — so "this configuration has
  been validated" was never a fact about the file and the environment alone. Renaming a service
  while `CONFIG_PATH`, `DEPLOY_ENV` and the config's bytes stayed put left the marker matching, so
  the refusal a fresh marker directory produces was skipped and the service came up with a title
  prefix that fails every ntfy send. It is the same defect the per-environment marker fixed, with
  `service` in the place of `env`. ⚠️ **In the CONTENTS, not the filename** — the ops-alerting
  standard fixes the name at `.alerting-validated-<env>`, so line one is still `sha256:<hex>` and
  nothing else, and anything reading the FIRST LINE reads the digest correctly — which is not
  the same as backward compatible; see the rollback note above.
  Line two is `service:"<name>"`, JSON-encoded so that a name carrying a quote, a non-ASCII
  letter or a control character cannot split into a line the parser could never read back — which
  would be a marker that matches nothing forever, re-announcing on every boot. `json.loads` is
  also recursive and `RecursionError` is not a `ValueError`, so the reader refuses any payload
  that does not open with a quote before the parser sees it — a marker of two thousand `[` used
  to leave `validate_boot` as a bare traceback, past the `except AlertEnvError` the setup
  document tells adopters to write. See the migration note above: this is what makes every
  service re-validate once, and the two notes beside it for the rollback and the shared
  `CONFIG_PATH`.
- **A `logger_name` that raises cannot cost a config load.** Found while adding the field: a
  bare `getattr(settings, "logger_name", "")` suppresses only `AttributeError`, so a property
  raising anything else propagated out of `AlertConfig.load` and turned a boot report that said
  "ALERTING UNCONFIGURED" into "ALERTING CONFIG UNREADABLE". Read through a helper that never
  raises, the same contract `_title_prefix` has had for the same reason.

### Changed

- `repr(AlertConfig)` prints the new `logger_name` field. `SMTP_PASSWORD` stays masked.

### Declared rather than closed

- **#26** — a binary suffix plus ONE NUL inside git's 8000-byte window still hides plain text from
  every scan. The residual of the narrowed suffix rule, measured, with the three ways to close it
  and what each costs.
- **#27** — the range and `--staged` scans blank a NUL-bearing line without disclosing it, where
  the tree scan says so. `parse_diff` cannot currently tell that case from an ordinary binary
  diff.
- **#28** — a clean latin-1 file reds the TREE scan while `--staged` and `--range` clear it, and
  the same bytes under a binary-hinting NAME pass all three. Measured identical on 1.4.1, so this
  release neither introduced nor widened it; closing it means deciding whether a non-UTF-8 file at
  an ordinary path should be scanned with replacement characters or stay refused, which is a
  behaviour change of its own.
- **The annotated-tag SCOPE differs from the sibling's, deliberately.** This engine scans the tag
  object the RANGE NAMES; the sibling scans a tag pointing at a commit in the range. Neither is a
  defect and the difference is measurable: a tag cut at an ALREADY-PUSHED commit (the ordinary
  release gesture, where the range covers zero commits) is scanned here and is a stated gap there,
  while a tag on an in-range commit that the push does not send is scanned there and not here.
  CI passes `$GITHUB_REF`, so the release path is covered. Ref NAMES are scanned by no layer —
  see the note in `refs_being_published`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-05

The audit pass: the open issue list measured against the published wheel and burned down, and a
read-only sweep of the code for the siblings of what 1.4.0 fixed. Nothing here changes a name in
any module's `__all__`; one exported signature is WIDENED (`read_jsonl_tail` accepts `backups=None`
again). Every fix carries the test that would have caught it.

### Fixed

- **The two sink detectors ask whether the sink can be CREATED, not whether its directory exists
  (#23).** `error_log_problem()` answered "no problem" in five states where the first WARN or
  ERROR alert then failed to record itself — a file (or a symlink to nowhere) standing where the
  log directory should be, a trailing separator, the sink being itself a directory, a NUL in the
  path — because `os.path.isdir` is False for every one of them and the parent arm then found a
  perfectly writable grandparent. And it reddened the opposite case: `<mount>/svc/logs/errors.log`
  with `<mount>` mounted and `svc/` not yet created was reported "the volume is not mounted",
  when `makedirs` handles it on the first alert. One walk to the first existing ancestor now
  serves both `error_log_problem()` and `state_file_problem()`, asked the way each writer
  writes (the error log `makedirs`; the state file does not), and the "not mounted" diagnosis
  fires only when nothing on the way exists except the filesystem root — which, on the Linux
  containers this ships to, no volume ever is. It does not fire off POSIX: a Windows DRIVE ROOT is
  a volume, and the gate measured the arm reddening `C:\svc-logs\errors.log` while the sink wrote
  there. `state_file_problem()` also stops saying "does not exist" about a file that is in the way,
  and both detectors now ask about the leaf. The test asserts the detector AGREES WITH THE SINK,
  by running the sink's own sequence for every planted state, in both directions.
- **`read_jsonl_tail(backups=None)` is accepted again (#5).** The reference implementation spelled
  `None` as "the module default"; the extraction turned an explicit `None` into a `TypeError` at
  the generation count, for exactly the `GET /v1/admin/errors` handler an adopter ports first.
- **`kw-leak-guard --repo <not-a-repository>` is a usage error, exit 2, one sentence (#12).** It
  used to let `CalledProcessError` escape `main` as a traceback with exit 1. "Git could not be run
  at all" is still an environment failure and still propagates as one.
- **Two inherited false reds in the shape denylist (#11).** `C:\Users\Administrator\…` — the
  canonical Windows Server built-in, which names nobody — joins `Public`, `Default`, `All Users`
  and `runneradmin` in the profile-path carve-out; RFC 9562's nil and max UUIDs (all zeroes, all
  `f`) get an allow-span, exactly as the RFC 5737 ranges and `example.com` have one, because they
  are the reserved placeholder convention for that shape. Each is pinned in the self-test corpus
  with its near-miss (`Administrator2`, one digit off the nil UUID) still firing.

- **The tree scan reads a tracked symlink as its LINK TEXT, not its target.** `read_bytes`
  follows a link, so the scan read whatever it pointed at and never the one thing git publishes
  for it: a link whose text named a LAN host, pointing at a clean file, scanned clean while the
  staged scan of the same index reported the host — a bypass through the tree scan, and the
  false-red half of the same defect for a clean link to a file outside the repository. Only a
  real symlink at a `120000` index entry is read as a link; a regular file the index merely calls
  a link (a spoofed `--cacheinfo`, or Windows with `core.symlinks=false`) is read as before.
- **A tag object git cannot read is reported, not dropped.** The tag walk `break`-ed on a
  `cat-file` failure and returned nothing — a tag the range scan could not vouch for, cleared in
  silence. It is an "unscannable" entry now, which is exit 1.
- **The sdist roll-call in both workflows is anchored at the top of the tarball.** Its `grep`
  was right-anchored only, so `vendor/tests/conftest.py` satisfied `/tests/conftest.py` with no
  top-level copy present (measured).
- **The error-log roller says when it cannot shift a generation.** Its loop was
  `except OSError: pass` — #21's shape one function up — so a `.2` that was a directory left
  `.1` in place, the unconditional move then overwrote it, and the oldest records were gone with
  nothing in the log. The roll still happens (refusing it lets the live file grow); the loss is
  reported with the errno. A generation that simply does not exist yet is still silent.
- **A state file holding valid JSON that is not an object gets the same WARNING invalid JSON
  gets**, and a state entry that is not a record says so when it is replaced. Both became `{}`
  in silence one branch below the line the unparseable case earns. ⚠️ The READ rewrites such a
  file empty, so the line fires once rather than on every notification — an `OK` never writes
  the state file unless it clears something, and a heartbeat-only service would otherwise have
  read the same list forever. Where the rewrite itself fails, "could not save" appears beside it.
- **`email_ready()` refuses the credential the send path refuses.** A non-ASCII `SMTP_USER` or
  `SMTP_PASSWORD` was rejected by `_send_email` (before smtplib could quote the character) and
  reported READY by the readiness check — so the boot report and `validate_boot` called usable a
  channel that then failed every send. Key name in the log, never the value. ⚠️ **This is a new
  boot refusal**: a deployment that booted on 1.4.0 with such a credential (email failing on
  every send, ntfy delivering) is refused by `validate_boot` on its next re-validation — a fresh
  install, an edited config, or a deleted marker; a matching marker still skips. `notify()`'s
  email result for that configuration changes from `"failed"` to `"skipped"`, and the boot
  report names the key at ERROR instead of listing email as ready.
- **A partial recipient refusal is reported.** `send_message` raises only when every recipient
  is refused; when some are it returns them, and the send counted as delivered — the operator who
  was dropped never heard from the service again and nothing said so. The count is logged, never
  the addresses.
- **A NUL in `SHARED_ROOT` or `CONFIG_PATH` is a refusal or a warning, not a traceback.** The
  `except OSError` arms around every path operation on the two paths let the `ValueError` a NUL
  raises escape `validate_boot` bare — four of them reachably (the digest, the marker read, the
  marker write and its temp discard; the three post-write arms are widened for the same class
  and are not reachable by a NUL, since no marker is written) — the class `_checked_is_dir`
  closed in 1.4.0, one exception type over.

### Security

- **`repr(AlertConfig)` shows `SMTP_PASSWORD` as `<set>`/`<unset>`, never its value.** A dataclass
  repr prints every field, and `Alerter.config()` hands this object to any adopter — so
  `repr(alerter.config())` in a debug line or a boot-time settings dump was the shared file's
  password in the process log. The same class of escape as 1.4.0's marker digest, through a
  different door. Every other field stays readable; `dataclasses.asdict()` and pickling still
  carry the value, as they must — the repr is the one that lands in a log by accident.
- **The de-duplication state file is created `0600`, the same way the marker and the error log
  are.** It was written by a bare `open()` at the umask's mode — `0644` into a shared appdata
  volume — and it persists every firing condition's title. `os.open(…, 0o600)` into a temporary
  file, then `os.replace`, so a wide file left by an earlier build is narrowed on its next write
  with no `chmod` (the call that fails on a uid-mismatched mount, #21); a temp left by a killed
  process is removed rather than reused, and a failed rename removes its own temp.

### Tests

- **The generic-code contract is enforced for every module (#12)** — its six testable clauses;
  the seventh, "tests travel with the module", is what the packaging job proves by unpacking the
  sdist and running its suite, not something a test can assert about itself. `tests/test_isolation.py`
  bound one `MODULE_PATH` — `alerting.py` — so its checks measured that module and no other while
  the README said the contract held for all of them. It is parametrised over `src/kw_common/*.py`
  now: isolation, stdlib-only, no environment read (the environment layer's reads are pinned to
  exactly the three declared variables, by behaviour), no module-level absolute path, an explicit
  and consistent `__all__`, and the ONE allowed intra-package import edge (`alerting_env` →
  `alerting`) asserted in both directions — as data, so a new edge is a deliberate edit.
- **The v1.0.0 mutation survivors are pinned (#6, items 2–11).** Measured first: 20 of 27
  mutations survived the suite. Each has the test that catches it now — the restore branch of a
  failed delivery, the two snapshot guards removed together, two of the three opt-out gates
  (planted with a file literally named `None`; `notify`'s own is uncatchable by construction,
  the other two make it a no-op), every default sizing constant, WARN's log level and both
  channels' ntfy tag and priority, `_prune`'s
  ordering and junk key, `read_jsonl_tail`'s `limit=None`, non-object records and `keep`
  predicate, the `since` boundary and both naive-timestamp branches, and the missing-file path
  that must not warn.
- **The editable install in both leak-guard CI jobs is pinned (#13).** `pip install -e .` is what
  keeps the guard's own synthetic corpus out of a range scan of this repository's history; a
  comment at each install step says so, and a test fails if either job's install line stops being
  editable or a non-editable install of the package follows it.

### Changed

- The operator-facing remedy for an unreadable file no longer says "add its suffix to
  `SKIP_SUFFIXES`" — a constant of the installed engine that no repository can extend. It names
  the suffixes that exist and what a consumer can actually do; two docstrings that pointed at
  `ALLOW_LITERALS` now point at the `allow_literals` key in `.leakguard.json`, which is the
  injected form.
- The module docstring's "what this module will not put in a log" is scoped to what
  `_secret_values` actually covers: the SMTP password and the topic URL. `EMAIL_TO`, `EMAIL_FROM`
  and `SMTP_USER` are quoted by smtplib's own refusals and are not redacted; that is stated rather
  than implied away.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-04

What the first adopter found. Every item here came out of this library meeting a real bind mount,
a real uid mismatch and a real shared volume — none of which a unit test on a developer machine
reproduces, and two of which this project had introduced itself one release earlier.

### Security

- **The validation marker is created `0600` (#20).** Its contents are a sha256 of the shared
  config, and that file holds `SMTP_PASSWORD`. Written `0644` into a shared appdata volume, that
  is an **offline verification oracle**: anything with the volume mounted can confirm a guess at
  the file's contents against the digest, at no rate limit, with no connection to the mail
  provider and no log line anywhere. 1.3.0 introduced it — the empty marker it replaced had
  nothing to leak — which makes it the most direct kind of regression: a security property traded
  away to buy a correctness one, without anyone noticing the trade.

  The write is now `os.open(..., 0o600)` into a temporary file and `os.replace` into position,
  **not a `chmod`**, and the difference is load-bearing rather than stylistic. A `chmod` is
  exactly the call that fails on a uid-mismatched bind mount (#21 below), so the obvious fix would
  have narrowed nothing on the deployments that need it most while every test went green.
  `os.replace` needs only the directory to be writable — and it must be, or there would be no
  marker at all — so a `0644` marker an earlier version left behind is replaced rather than
  adjusted in place. Where the filesystem cannot express the mode (vfat, most CIFS mounts) the
  boot log says so and the marker is KEPT: deleting it would fail open into re-validating and
  re-announcing on every boot, and on such a mount `alerting.env` itself is equally readable and
  holds the password in the clear rather than a digest of it.

  ⛔ **An HMAC instead of a digest does not solve this**, and the reasoning is in the code so it is
  not re-opened as an improvement: a keyed MAC only helps if the reader cannot obtain the key, and
  every candidate key lives in the same volume as the marker. A salt defeats precomputation, not
  guessing. Only the marker's own unreadability removes the oracle.

- **A refused `chmod` is reported instead of swallowed (#21).** `_restrict()` was
  `except OSError: pass`. On a bind mount whose uid does not match the container's user — the
  ordinary case for host-managed appdata — the call raises `EPERM` and the failure was discarded,
  so a no-op was indistinguishable from a hardening and the code, its docstrings and the fleet
  standard all claimed a file was `0600` that was `0644`. It now logs a warning naming the path,
  the mode it was trying to reach and the errno; the success path stays silent, because a
  permission helper that spoke on every call would be filtered out and the signal would be worth
  nothing. It warns rather than raising: every call site is inside the error-log append, whose
  contract is that recording an alert never raises, so the failure is loud and the alert still
  lands.

  The test that covered this was named `test_restrict_is_silent_when_chmod_refuses`. It asserted
  only that nothing raised, but its name recorded the swallowed failure as the intended behaviour
  — so the defect had a test that read like an endorsement. Not raising and saying nothing are two
  claims, and they are now made separately.

### Fixed

- **`error_log_problem()` no longer reports healthy for the one condition it exists to catch
  (#22).** When the log's directory was absent under a parent that exists but cannot be written,
  it returned `""` — no problem — which is precisely the state in which the sink cannot be
  written. So the sink failed and its own detector agreed nothing was wrong: **both operator
  signals gone at once, for the same underlying cause.** That is worse than having no detector,
  because it stops the operator looking. The three states are now distinguished — checked and
  fine, checked and broken, could not check — and an uncreatable directory is the second.

- **A missing MOUNT and a missing FILE now say different things on the sequence the setup document
  prescribes.** `validate_boot` has always carried a mount-specific refusal, and on that sequence
  it never fired: the loader calls `read_config` first, so both cases arrived as one
  undifferentiated "does not exist". Measured both ways by the first adopter.
  `load_alert_settings_from_env` now asks the mount question BEFORE the read, and it asks it of
  `SHARED_ROOT`.

  ⛔ **It is not asked of the config file's own path, and the first attempt at this release did
  exactly that and was wrong in both directions.** The config lives at
  `<shared root>/configs/alerting.env`, so its own directory is one level BELOW the mount: a
  correctly mounted volume whose `configs/` had not been created yet — the ordinary state between
  steps 1 and 2 of the setup document — was told its volume was missing, and a `configs/` baked
  into an image at the mountpoint with no volume over it was told the volume was fine and to go
  and create the file, which it would then have created in the disposable layer. Only the
  `SHARED_ROOT` value can answer the question, and it is now asked of that.

### Adopters

A service already running 1.3.0 has a marker that records the CORRECT digest at the wrong mode, so
it matches and validation skips — and the write that narrows it would never run. Narrowing only
the write path would have fixed new installations and left every existing one exposed until
somebody happened to edit the shared config. So the first boot after this upgrade rewrites the
marker in place: **same contents, narrower mode, no re-validation and no duplicate confirmation
alert.** One `INFO` line says it happened.

A service on a uid-mismatched volume will also start seeing warnings about the error log's
permissions. The rule, rather than a number: **one warning per refused `chmod`, and a WARN or
ERROR alert attempts up to three** — the log directory, the log file before the write, and the log
file again after it. Two things decide how many of those are refused, and it is worth knowing both
before reading the count as a new fault:

- **which paths this process does not own.** A file it created itself it can always `chmod`; one
  the host owns, or that an earlier container created as another uid, it cannot.
- **whether the log file exists yet.** The pre-write narrowing is silent on a path that is not
  there, so the FIRST alert against a fresh log is always one lower than the steady state.

Measured against the real record path — first alert, then steady state:

| state | warnings |
|---|---|
| the container created the directory and the log file | 0, then 0 |
| the host owns the log directory only | 1, then 1 |
| the host owns the directory and the log file already exists | 3, then 3 |
| the host owns the directory and the log file is not there yet | 2, then 3 |
| a filesystem that refuses every `chmod` (vfat, most CIFS), log file present | 3, then 3 |
| the same, against a fresh log | 2, then 3 |

An `error_log` with no directory component attempts two rather than three, since there is no
directory to create or narrow. The condition was already there; this is the release that stops
hiding it, and the volume is the honest measure of how often it was happening in silence.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-03

A check that shipped inside the thing it was checking, and a marker that recorded the wrong fact.

### Security

- **The private-name check no longer publishes the list it enforces (#16).** It asked ONE file —
  the guard's own source — while everything else the wheel and the sdist carry went unchecked, and
  it carried the forbidden names as a plain tuple in a test file that `MANIFEST.in` puts inside
  every published tarball. Both halves were wrong, and the second made the first unfixable in
  place: widening the test's reach while the list stayed would have made the disclosure worse, and
  hashing or splitting the list in-repo is the same disclosure with extra steps.

  Measured against the artifacts 1.2.0 actually published: **17 occurrences in 4 files of the
  sdist**, 0 in the wheel — the one file any check looked at was the one file that was clean, and
  every occurrence was in a test the wheel does not carry and `recursive-include tests *.py` puts
  in the tarball. The list moved OUT of this repository, into a guard committed to no repository
  at all. The same measurement against 1.3.0's wheel and sdist: 0 and 0.

- **`.githooks/pre-push` (#10).** The check moved to the moment publication happens. CI catches a
  leak *after* the push, and a push to a public remote is permanent — the value stays readable at
  the commit that added it, in every clone, and the repair is a history rewrite. The hook scans
  the working tree (what the artifacts are built from) and the commits each ref would publish, and
  **fails CLOSED when it is not configured**, because a guard that is silently not running looks
  exactly like a pass. Install: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` plus one config key naming
  the guard, so no operator path is written into this repository.

  ⚠️ **Declared bounds, stated rather than implied:** a hook is a local convention. Nothing here
  and nothing in CI can assert that it ran on somebody's machine, because CI must not have the
  list either. And `core.hooksPath .githooks` is a RELATIVE path, so a checkout that predates the
  hook has none and git says nothing — filed as #17, since closing it is a workstation install
  rather than a package change.

  `tests/test_leak_guard_hook.py` drives the real hook against a real `git push` to a real bare
  remote and asserts whether the REMOTE REF MOVED — refused for a leaking commit, for a value a
  LATER COMMIT REMOVED (the worktree is clean, so only the commit scan can see it), for a leaking
  worktree, for the second ref of a two-ref push, and for an unconfigured guard; allowed for a
  clean push, and — even when the worktree carries a finding — for the two pushes that publish
  NOTHING: a branch deletion, and one git reports `Everything up-to-date`. Refusing either of
  those blocks the cleanup itself. A brand-new branch is scanned with
  `--not --remotes=<the remote being pushed to>` — bare `--remotes` spans EVERY remote, so a
  branch already fetched from a private one had its whole history excluded and published unread.

### Changed

- **The boot marker records the config's sha256 instead of relying on its own timestamp (#15).**
  `rsync -a`, `cp -p`, `tar -x` and volume restores all PRESERVE mtime, so a config restored at an
  older timestamp left the marker still newer: a file nobody had checked booted clean, announced
  nothing, and the service came up alerting no one. A timestamp cannot answer "did the contents
  change"; a digest can, whatever the clock says.

  Contents decide in both directions — a restore with different bytes re-validates, an identical
  restore does not, so a routine backup restore does not page anybody. The digest is over the RAW
  BYTES, so a silent re-encode (the cp1252 file this module refuses at boot) re-validates too.

  Two things go away with the old mechanism. The coarse-filesystem defect: on a one-second
  granularity filesystem the config and the marker landed on the same second, the marker could
  never be strictly newer, and every boot re-validated and re-alerted forever — `_outrank`, which
  existed only to break that tie, is deleted rather than kept. And the one-second window it left,
  where a config edited in the second after a boot was skipped.

- **`py.typed`** — PEP 561's marker, so a consumer's mypy actually reads the annotations this
  package already carried. Asserted against the BUILT WHEEL rather than the source tree: it is
  data, `packages.find` does not carry it, so it could be committed, read as done, and be absent
  from the artifact with nothing in this repository noticing.

- **Consumer counts are out of the prose.** How many services a library is installed on is the
  operator's estate, not the library's documentation, and this repository is public.

### Fixed

- **`_RefuseRedirects` described the ntfy `Title` as `[ERROR] <service>: <title>`.** It is
  `[SEV] <title>`; the service name has never been in that header. On a shared topic
  `AlertSettings.title_prefix` puts `[<env>][<service>] ` at the front of the TITLE, which is a
  property of the topic rather than of the header — the docstring conflated the two.

### Notes for adopters

- **Upgrading costs exactly one re-validation — and one alert per service.** A marker written by
  1.2.0 is empty, so it matches no digest; the first boot after the upgrade validates, SENDS ONE
  CONFIRMATION, and rewrites the marker. No operator step is needed, and there is no way to carry
  a stale "validated" verdict across the upgrade, which is the direction that matters — but a
  fleet-wide upgrade produces one email and one push per service, so expect the traffic rather
  than wondering what caused it.
- **`touch` is no longer the remedy after a restore, and is no longer needed.** To force a
  re-check without editing the file, delete `CONFIG_PATH/.alerting-validated-<env>`.
- **The public surface is unchanged.** Nothing was added to or removed from any module's
  `__all__`; the digest helper is deliberately private.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-03

The alerting **convention** becomes a function signature. The ops-alerting standard has specified
one shared configuration file and three container variables for a while; the templates each
declared a different shape of alerting variable and **not one declared the variable the standard
actually names**, because a convention that exists only as prose gets interpreted. This release
makes it executable: a missing variable is now an error at boot rather than a divergence
discovered when an alert does not arrive.

`kw_common.alerting` stays environment-free — that is what makes it portable, and putting file and
environment reading back into it would undo the removal 1.0.1 made deliberately. The deployment
knowledge lives in a **sibling module** instead.

### Added

- **`kw_common.alerting_env`** — two layers, on purpose:
  - `load_alert_settings(config_path, deploy_env, service)` is pure. It reads no environment
    variable and has no default path, so it works outside this deployment and is testable without
    touching `os.environ`.
  - `load_alert_settings_from_env(service)` is the convention: it reads `SHARED_ROOT` and
    `DEPLOY_ENV` and **refuses, loudly, when either is unset or blank.** Blank is refused as well
    as absent, because a container platform passes an unfilled Variable as an empty string.
- **`validate_boot(...)` / `validate_boot_from_env(...)`** — the startup check. It verifies the
  mount, the structure, that the file is readable, that every key this environment requires carries
  a value that is not still the template's `CHANGE-ME`, and that every configured channel is one
  the library can actually SEND on. On success it sends **one** confirmation alert and writes an
  empty marker into `CONFIG_PATH`; later boots skip while that marker is newer than the config
  file. The marker is **per environment**, so a dev → prod promotion re-validates even though the
  shared file did not change.
  ⛔ **A failure logs and raises and does not attempt to alert** — it cannot report a broken
  alerting channel through that channel. With no `Alerter` installed it validates but does NOT
  write the marker, so a confirmation that could not be sent is not silently marked as sent.
- **The required-key manifest, owned here** — `required_keys(deploy_env)`. Otherwise every app
  answers "what does prod require?" independently and they disagree the first time a key is added.
- **`alerting.env.template`** and **`docs/alerting-setup.md`** — the setup contract, owned once.
  Per-OS commands create the structure and fetch the template with `mkdir` + `curl -fLo` or
  `New-Item` + `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile`; **nothing is piped into a shell**, and the page says
  to review any file you download and that you proceed at your own risk. A consumer README carries
  a prerequisite block and a **link** to that page — never a copy.
- **`AlertSettings.title_prefix`** — applied to the email subject and the ntfy title, and to
  nothing else. A control character in it is refused: it becomes an HTTP header value and a mail
  `Subject`, both of which reject one, so such a prefix would fail every alert on every channel
  while the boot report still said both were ready.

### Changed

- **`SMTP_USER` is now OPTIONAL and defaults to `EMAIL_FROM` — when, and only when, that is a
  bare ASCII mailbox.** They are the same value in this deployment today and they are different
  things: `SMTP_USER` is the auth identity, `EMAIL_FROM` is the header. A From header may
  legitimately read `Alerts <box@host>` or carry a non-ASCII display name, and neither is a
  credential — deriving one from the other made `email_ready()` report READY for a channel that
  then failed 100% of sends, which is the "dead while looking configured" failure this module's
  docstrings call its worst. Where the two cannot be the same, the key is simply required, and the
  existing diagnostic already says so. A file that sets it explicitly is always honoured, which is
  what a verified alias or a relay whose user is literally `apikey` needs. Applied where the file
  is READ, so it survives the per-notification re-read that lets a password rotation take effect
  without a restart.
- **`_parse_env_file` split into a read and a parse.** One parser, two error policies: `alerting`
  reads fail-soft (a missing or mis-encoded file means the email channel is unconfigured, which is
  right for a notification already in flight) and `alerting_env.read_config` reads fail-loud (at
  boot, "the file is empty" and "the file is UTF-16" must not look alike). A second parser would
  let boot validation accept a file the send path then reads differently.
- `tests/test_readme.py` demanded EXACTLY ONE `python` block in the README, which was a bound on
  the document rather than a property of it — and the cheapest way to satisfy it was to delete a
  block. It now checks every block, per block.

### Notes for adopters

- **The title prefix is a property of the TOPIC, not of the service.** A service on the shared
  environment topic gets `[<env>][<service>]` in front of its alert titles, because on a shared
  topic nothing else says who is talking. A service with its own `NTFY_URL_<SERVICE>` topic gets
  **no** prefix. A service that already has its own topic keeps exactly what it does today.
- **The prefix reaches the two outbound channels and nothing else.** The de-duplication state key,
  the retrievable error record and the process log line all keep the RAW title, so promoting a
  service from dev to prod does not re-page every escalating condition it had already reported.
- **`NTFY_URL_<SERVICE>` has exactly one spelling**: the service name upper-cased, with each RUN
  of characters that are not an ASCII letter or digit replaced by a SINGLE `_` and the ends
  dropped — so `backup-agent` is `NTFY_URL_BACKUP_AGENT`, `feed--poller` is `NTFY_URL_FEED_POLLER`
  rather than `FEED__POLLER`, and `café-poller` is `NTFY_URL_CAF_POLLER`. A
  key spelled any other way is never looked up and the service quietly lands back on the shared
  topic with a prefix it should not have. `alerting_env.ntfy_key(service)` returns the answer, and
  the template's worked examples are checked against it by a test rather than by proofreading.
- **`state_file` and `error_log` are NOT in the shared file and are not loader arguments.** They
  are the app's own paths under its own volume; use `dataclasses.replace(settings, ...)`.
- **`NTFY_URL_<ENV>` is required even for a service that has its own topic.** The file is shared:
  a file missing `NTFY_URL_PROD` is broken for every service without an override, and the next
  service to adopt is exactly that one.
- **A service may not be named after an environment.** `dev` or `prod` derives
  `NTFY_URL_DEV`/`NTFY_URL_PROD` — keys the shared file always carries — so it would read a shared
  topic as its own dedicated one: wrong topic, no prefix, and a confirmation alert saying it is on
  its own. Refused by `ntfy_key`.
- **The marker is a TIMESTAMP comparison, and that is its limit.** A config file restored at an
  older mtime (`rsync -a`, `cp -p`, `tar -x`, a volume restore) leaves the marker still newer, so
  that change is not re-validated. `touch` the file after a restore.
  ⛔ **SUPERSEDED IN 1.3.0** — the marker records the config's sha256 and the `touch` remedy is
  neither needed nor sufficient. Kept because it is what 1.2.0 did; do not act on it.
- ⚠️ **`CONFIG_PATH` is not the config file.** `load_alert_settings`'s first parameter is called
  `config_path` and is the alerting.env FILE; the `CONFIG_PATH` variable is the app's own
  read-write DIRECTORY, where the marker goes. The validation function spells that one
  `marker_dir` rather than repeating the ambiguity.

### Out of scope, deliberately

Adopting this anywhere — each service's adoption is its own package — any container template edit,
and user-facing notifications, which run off per-user preferences and never share a channel, a
topic or a config file with operator alerting.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-02

The leak guard becomes a module. It was a **file each repository kept its own copy of**, with one
of its test suites copied alongside it — so a fix made in one reached none of the others, and four
separate engine improvements had to be re-ported by hand after being made once upstream.
A copy cannot be pinned. This release ends that the same way the alerting module did: a consumer
installs a version.

Nothing here changes what a scan CATCHES. The detection patterns, the three scan shapes
(tree / index / commit range) and the four engine-add surfaces are the canonical behaviour and are
unchanged — verified by AST against the seven canonical fixes, by the shipped self-test, and by
the 4,200 lines of engine tests that moved here with the code.

### Added

- **`kw_common.leakguard`** — the engine, importable, with a **`kw-leak-guard`** console entry
  point (`python -m kw_common.leakguard` works identically). It imports nothing from the rest of
  the package and depends on nothing outside the standard library.
- **Injected configuration: `.leakguard.json` in the repository being scanned**, or a path given
  with `--config`. This is the part that makes the extraction possible at all — see the adopter
  notes below for the format and for the five fail-closed properties it was designed around.
- **`--config <path>` / `--config=<path>`** on the command line, and `GuardConfig`,
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `ConfigError`, `find_config`, `load_config`, `parse_config`, `apply_config`,
  `CONFIG_FILENAME` and `cli` in the module's `__all__`.
- **A configuration that stops the guard's own DENY CASES being caught is refused**, on any of
  the three surfaces, with exit 2 naming the case it defeats. ⚠️ Read that literally: the check
  is CORPUS-SHAPED. It refuses a literal that silences one of a finite set of samples, so the
  pool root the corpus spells is refused and another pool name is not — and an accepted literal
  is not narrow, since allowing a pool root silences that pool everywhere. It is a backstop
  against the careless case, not a proof that the format cannot be misused. What keeps an
  allow-list honest is that every entry is an exact literal, spelled out, justified, and read
  from the index.

### Fixed

- **An installed guard no longer exempts an arbitrary file in the repository it scans** — a
  security fix, not tidying, and one whose FIRST answer was wrong in the same way. The self-exemption resolved `__file__` relative to the scanned root
  and **fell back to the constant `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py`** when that failed. It fails
  on **every run of an installed guard**, because `site-packages` is not inside the repository
  being scanned — so the fallback would have exempted whatever the consumer kept at that path,
  which is the exact path every repository in this fleet vendored its copy at. The first consumer
  to install this package and delete its old script would have handed a permanent, invisible
  amnesty to any file that later took that name. The resolver now answers "not mine" instead of
  guessing, and a repository that genuinely vendors the guard still skips its own copy.

  ⚠️ THAT LEFT THE SAME HOLE ONE LAYER OUT, and the verification gate found it. The repository
  that OWNS the engine keeps its source as an ordinary tracked file, full of synthetic deny cases
  — so with the path exemption gone, an installed guard reported all of them. The first answer was
  a `path_exempt` entry per pattern in that repository's own config; since the engine has exactly
  as many patterns as that list had entries, it was a whole-file skip written in data, and a REAL
  leak appended to the engine's source PASSED. The guard now recognises its own source by its
  BYTES: nothing else in any repository can claim that, and no configuration can widen it.
- **The finding banner no longer claims "this repo is public."** True of the one repository the
  guard was vendored into, false for most of the ones it now scans — and a sentence a reader uses
  to decide a finding does not apply to them. It states what holds everywhere instead: a commit is
  permanent.
- **The docstring's account of which repositories are public was wrong for the second time**, now
  in the opposite direction: it named one repository as the only public one, which was true when
  written and false by the time this module shipped from a second public repository — the one that
  publishes this file to everyone who installs the library. Both errors are recorded rather than
  quietly overwritten.
- **The private sibling repositories are no longer named anywhere in the engine.** `MANIFEST.in`
  had kept the guard out of the sdist for exactly that reason; the module now ships inside the
  **wheel**, so exclusion is no longer available as the fix. Provenance comments cite
  `consumer#NN`.
  ⛔ **SUPERSEDED IN 1.3.0** — "a test enforces the absence" was true of one file and stopped
  being true at all: that test is deleted and `.githooks/pre-push` holds the line now.
- **A `.leakguard.json` that is not tracked by git is refused.** An ignored config governed every
  local scan while being invisible to review, which is the opposite of the property that justifies
  injecting the allowances at all.
- **A UTF-8 BOM on an otherwise valid config no longer reddens the build.** Windows PowerShell 5.1
  and Notepad both write one; the config is read as `utf-8-sig`.
- **The `--staged` banner no longer claims "this repo is public" either.** The tree and range
  banners were corrected and this one was missed — the instance, not the class, inside an edit
  whose entire subject was a false claim.
- Two incidental repairs the move surfaced, neither of which changes a verdict: `zip(..., strict=)`
  where the lengths were already asserted equal, and a rebound name in `selftest()` that made the
  type checker right about a real type error.

  ⚠️ An earlier draft of this entry claimed a third — "a false-positive PATH report that
  interpolated the CONTENT loop's findings instead of its own". **That bug never existed**: the
  pre-move file assigns the name inside the same loop, one line above its use, so the report was
  always correct. A verification agent checked the claim against the original and it was false.
  Recorded rather than deleted, because a changelog that invents a fix is the same defect class as
  a comment that invents one.

### Notes for adopters

**This release does not change your CI's answer. It changes where the guard comes from.** A
repository adopting it deletes its vendored `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py`, pins
`kw-common@v1.1.0`, and calls `kw-leak-guard` instead of `python scripts/check_no_internal_info.py`.

⛔ **Do not delete your vendored copy without first moving its `ALLOW_LITERALS` tail into
`.leakguard.json`.** That tail is the per-repository configuration the whole extraction exists to
rescue, and the engine now ships with it **empty** — the library assumes nothing about its
consumer. Deleting the script without porting the tail turns your allowances off, which reddens CI
on lines that were previously, and correctly, permitted.

```json
{
  "_note": "a key prefixed with `_` is a comment - the only spelling this scanner ignores",
  "allow_literals": [
    {"literal": "github.com/<owner>", "why": "functional: this repository's own clone URL"}
  ]
}
```

`allow_literals` is the whole surface. It suppresses a hit that falls INSIDE an exact literal; it
cannot remove a pattern, widen one, or skip a file. Five properties, each chosen in the fail-closed
direction and each worth knowing before you write a config:

1. **No config file means nothing is allowed.** A missing or misnamed file can only make a scan
   *stricter*. The opposite default — shipping this fleet's own allowances — would mean an
   installed library silently permitting values in a repository that never asked, and a consumer
   would have to edit installed code to tighten it, which is the fork this package exists to
   prevent.
2. **The config is read from the INDEX, not from your working copy.** What governs a scan is
   exactly what a commit would record, so `git add` an edit before expecting it to apply — the
   guard prints a note when the two differ. A file on disk that the index does not have is an
   error rather than silence. `--config <path>` is exempt: it is written out in the invocation,
   which is the visibility that matters.
3. **A config this scanner cannot understand STOPS the scan** (exit 2). It never degrades to "no
   config": an unknown or misspelled key, a missing `why`, a `--config` path that does not exist.
   The difference between "your rules were applied" and "your rules were unreadable, so none were"
   is invisible in a clean verdict. A UTF-8 BOM is accepted — Windows editors write them, and
   reddening a correct config is how a guard gets switched off.
4. **`why` is required on every entry**, so "keep each one justified" is enforced rather than
   requested. An entry whose justification is blank or whitespace is refused.
5. **The only file whose CONTENT is skipped outright is the guard's own source, recognised as
   its own.** (A `SKIP_SUFFIXES` asset whose bytes really are binary is skipped as well; a text
   file merely NAMED `.png` is not.) Either it is
   literally that file — you vendored the guard inside the repository it scans, or installed it in
   editable mode from there — or the file's BYTES are the running guard's own bytes. Nothing else
   in your repository can claim either.

   ⚠️ Stated precisely, because the short version of it is wrong: where the running guard IS the
   repository's own file, that file's content is skipped UNCONDITIONALLY. That is inherent in a
   guard whose source carries its own deny corpus; the layer that covers that one file is a
   separate real-literal check run from outside the repository, which deliberately does not skip
   it.

**There is no path-exemption setting.** A repository could briefly excuse one named pattern on one
path regex, and both attempts to bound that regex were fail-open, one review round apart: the first
never measured it (`{"path_regex": "."}` turned a pattern off tree-wide and was accepted); the
second measured the deny corpus at a list of "ordinary" probe paths, which is a nine-name allowlist
wearing the word "property" — `\.go$` and `^internal/` sailed past it, a negative lookahead over
the nine names turned a pattern off everywhere in one line, and it REFUSED the narrowest exemption
there is (a single file) whenever that file was called `README.md` or `Dockerfile`. No acceptance
criterion asked for it, so it was withdrawn rather than repaired a third time. A config naming
`path_exempt` is refused with a message saying so, and `PATH_EXEMPT` survives as an engine constant
that only an edit to the module changes.

**If your repository keeps a leak-guard corpus of its own** (synthetic deny cases, fixtures full
of `.lan` hosts), there is no setting for it: assemble those values at RUNTIME from fragments,
the way this repository's own test suites do, so the file carries no matchable literal at rest.
This repository's `.leakguard.json` is the worked example of what a config now looks like, and
the suite reads the real file so a broken config here fails a test here.

**What is NOT in this release:** adoption anywhere. Each consuming repository takes it as its own
change, and `unraid-templates` — where this engine came from — should re-adopt rather than keep its
byte-identical copy.

**A note for whoever ports the tests.** Five `.githooks`-shaped tests did not travel: they assert
how a repository WIRES the guard up (the Windows `command -v python3` stub, `--not --remotes` on a
brand-new branch, the executable bit git silently needs, and two that run a real `git commit` and
check that HEAD did not move). Every one is a real lesson and none is a property of the engine.
Keep them beside your hooks; each removal site here says what it asserted.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-01

The three inherited security defects found during the v1.0.0 extraction and filed rather than
silently changed (#2, #3, #4), fixed before the first consumer adopts. All three are byte-identical
to the reference implementation, so they are live in it today; adopting this release is what
removes them rather than carrying them forward into one copy per consumer.

### Security

- **A channel failure no longer renders a configured secret into the log** (#2). The per-channel
  failure line — which repeats on **every** alert, in the log an operator is most likely to paste
  into a bug report — now passes the exception text through a redactor holding this config's
  `SMTP_PASSWORD` and its ntfy topic URL. The certificate-verification branch and `notify()`'s own
  "failed before any channel could be tried" line are redacted with it; all three rendered the
  exception verbatim.
  Both demonstrated leaks are additionally closed **at their source**, because a substring
  redactor cannot reach a secret quoted in transformed form:
  - `ntfy_ready()` now refuses a URL carrying **userinfo** (`https://user:pass@host/topic`). Such
    a URL never worked — `urllib` hands the whole netloc to `http.client`, which raises
    `InvalidURL` **quoting it** — so this converts a channel that failed on every send while
    printing its password into one refusal at boot. The host is judged **as the send path
    resolves it**: `urlsplit` returns the raw netloc while `urllib.request.Request` `unquote`s
    it, so a URL written `https://user:pw%40host/topic` has no `@` for a naive check to see and
    still arrives at `http.client` as `user:pw@host`. Asking the send path's own parser closes
    that whole class rather than enumerating escapes; `%20` and `%0d` went the same way.
    The host is then handed to **`http.client` itself** to accept or refuse, rather than to a
    predicate imitating it. `http.client` has never looked for an `@`: `_get_hostport` splits on
    the LAST COLON and raises `InvalidURL` quoting what follows it — so the colon is the trigger
    and the `@` was incidental, and `https://tok:hunter2%2540host/t`, `https://tok:hunter2/t`
    (no `@` anywhere) and an ordinary port typo `https://host:abc/t` each reported ready and then
    printed their own configuration on every alert. Constructing the connection object runs the
    real `_get_hostport`/`_validate_host` and opens no socket.
  - **A host outside latin-1 is refused.** `urllib` pre-adds the `Host` header, so
    `putrequest`'s IDNA branch never runs and `putheader` encodes latin-1 — measured, correcting
    an earlier claim in this file that a non-ASCII hostname "genuinely works". Such a host was
    ready and permanently dead, with a `UnicodeEncodeError` quoting the character. A latin-1
    hostname (`nötify.example`) is still accepted, because it does go out.
  - `ntfy_ready()` now refuses a **non-ASCII topic path or query**. `http.client` ASCII-encodes
    the request line, and its `UnicodeEncodeError` prints the offending character plus an index
    into the topic — the ntfy sibling of the SMTP refusal below, and equally beyond redaction's
    reach. Percent-encode the topic. A non-ASCII **host** is still accepted: `http.client`
    IDNA-encodes it, so it genuinely works.
  - `_send_email()` now refuses a **non-ASCII `SMTP_USER` or `SMTP_PASSWORD`** before `smtplib`
    sees it. `SMTP.auth` encodes both as ASCII, and its `UnicodeEncodeError` prints the offending
    character plus an offset into the value. The refusal names the setting and its length, exactly
    as `SMTP_PORT`'s does, and no connection is opened.
- **`ntfy_ready()` refuses a cleartext `http://` topic URL by default** (#3). A topic URL is a
  **write capability**, not an address: over cleartext it, the alert `Title` and the body are all
  readable by anything on the path, and the capability stays compromised afterwards.
- **The ntfy channel no longer follows redirects** (#4). `urlopen` re-issued a redirected request
  with the headers intact, so a `302` from the topic host delivered the alert `Title` — the most
  identifying part of the message — to a host the operator never configured, over any scheme the
  redirect named. A `3xx` is now a visible channel failure.

### Added

- `AlertSettings(allow_cleartext_ntfy=...)` — the supported opt-in for an `http://` topic on a
  trusted network. Defaults to `False`. Mirrored on `AlertConfig`, which is where `ntfy_ready()`
  reads it.
- Verification for `_restrict()`, the 0600/0700 narrowing (#6, item 1) — a security control that
  had a six-line justification and no test at all: gutting it to `pass` survived a 127-mutation
  sweep, and so did removing the deliberately redundant post-write call. The two tests that need
  real mode bits are POSIX-only and run on the CI matrix rather than on a Windows worktree, where
  `chmod` cannot express them; the two that assert *behaviour* (that `chmod` is not attempted on
  a missing path, and that a refused `chmod` stays silent) run everywhere. Measured on
  `ubuntu-latest`: 5 of 7 mutations caught, and the 2 survivors are the deliberate redundancies
  (`os.makedirs`' and `os.open`'s `mode=` arguments, each reaching the same end state as the
  `_restrict` call beside it).
- A test for the suite's own no-network property (`tests/test_no_network.py`). It was a guard with
  no test, and four mutations of it — including lifting the block entirely — left the whole suite
  green. The block now blocks every `smtplib.SMTP` subclass by walking the module rather than by a
  hand-written list (`SMTP_SSL` and then `LMTP` were each found un-blocked one round apart, which
  is the same fix-the-instance-not-the-class miss twice), and its loopback opt-out parses the host
  as an address instead of matching text — a `startswith("127.")` form admitted
  `127.evil.example`, a DNS name resolved off the machine.

### Fixed

- `_post_ntfy` **closes the response** instead of leaving the socket to the garbage collector — a
  slow descriptor leak on the one path that runs when things are already going wrong.
- The suite's network block covered `urlopen` only, so the ntfy channel's own opener walked
  straight past it into a real DNS lookup. It now blocks `OpenerDirector.open`, which covers every
  opener.
- The ntfy opener is built **on first send, not at import**, matching `urlopen`'s own timing.
  `build_opener()` constructs a `ProxyHandler` that snapshots `getproxies()` when it is built, so
  building it at import would have silently dropped proxying for any consumer that resolves its
  proxy environment in `main()`. The only thing this opener changes is redirect handling.

### Notes for adopters

- ⚠️ **A cleartext `http://` ntfy URL now disables the ntfy channel.** This is the one behaviour
  change that can turn a working channel off. It is loud — an `ERROR` line at readiness naming the
  scheme and the opt-in, and the boot report counts the channel as unconfigured — never silent.
  Two supported fixes, in order of preference: move the topic to `https://`, or pass
  `AlertSettings(allow_cleartext_ntfy=True)` to accept the exposure deliberately. Refusing outright
  was considered and rejected: a self-hosted ntfy on a trusted network is a real deployment, and a
  library whose only answer is "no" leaves a fork as the alternative.
- ⚠️ `allow_cleartext_ntfy` **must be a real `bool`.** A non-bool raises `ValueError` at
  construction rather than being coerced, because the string `"false"` is TRUE to Python — a
  deployment that spelled its opt-out correctly in a container Variable would otherwise have opted
  **in** by reading its own opt-out. Port it as
  `allow_cleartext_ntfy=os.environ.get("ALLOW_CLEARTEXT_NTFY", "") == "1"`, not as
  `bool(os.environ.get(...))`.
- ⚠️ **An ntfy URL carrying userinfo now disables the channel** — including a percent-encoded one
  (`user:pw%40host`) — instead of failing on every send. If a deployment appears to lose ntfy at
  this version, this is the likeliest cause, and that channel was never delivering. ntfy
  authentication belongs in a header (a token via a proxy), not in the URL.
- ⚠️ **A non-ASCII ntfy topic now disables the channel** instead of failing on every send. It
  never delivered either. Percent-encode the topic (`/geheim-t%C3%B6pic`); a non-ASCII hostname is
  unaffected.
- ⚠️ **A non-ASCII `SMTP_USER` or `SMTP_PASSWORD` now fails the email channel with a named
  refusal** rather than an opaque `UnicodeEncodeError` per send. Neither ever authenticated: SMTP
  AUTH cannot carry them. The value is not echoed; its length is.
- **What the redaction does NOT do**, stated because a guard that implies coverage it lacks is
  worse than none: it replaces a secret quoted **verbatim**. A message rendering one in transformed
  shape — an escaped `repr` of one character, a hash, a length — passes through. That is why the
  two demonstrated cases are closed at their source rather than left to it, and why the host half
  of an ntfy URL is deliberately **not** redacted: it carries the diagnostic value ("connection
  refused", a DNS failure) and is not itself the capability.
- No exported name changed, so no consumer needs a code change to take this release.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-30

First release. The alerting core, extracted from the fleet's reference implementation so that
every service runs the same code instead of a copy that drifts.

### Added

- **`kw_common.alerting`** — the `notify(severity, title, message, escalating=False, clears=None)`
  contract, fanning out to an email channel and an ntfy channel, with the severity driving the log
  level, the ntfy priority and tag, and the subject prefix.
  - `AlertSettings` / `configure()` / `Alerter` — **all configuration is injected**. The module
    reads no environment variable and ships no default path.
  - `AlertConfig` with `email_ready()`, `ntfy_ready()`, `smtp_port()` and `setting_faults()`;
    `smtp_port_fault()` as a pure classifier that logs nothing and sends nothing, so a boot-time
    settings report can reach the same verdict as the send path without provoking one.
  - Edge-trigger and escalating de-duplication over a state file, with `clears=` resolving a
    condition per title. De-duplication **fails open**: every error in the bookkeeping sends the
    alert.
  - A size-capped, rotating JSONL error log for WARN and ERROR, plus `read_jsonl_tail()` and
    `parse_since()` to read it back — the read path that a consuming service exposes as
    `GET /v1/admin/errors?since=&limit=`.
- The generic-code contract enforced as tests: isolated import in a subprocess with only the
  standard library on the path, an AST check that the module never reads the environment, and an
  AST check that no module-level constant holds an absolute path.
- CI on Python **3.10 and 3.12** (lint, type-check, tests), the leak guard (self-test, tree scan
  and commit-range scan), and a packaging job that installs the built wheel into a clean
  environment and imports it.
- A release workflow that refuses to publish when the tag and `kw_common.__version__` disagree.

### Notes for adopters

- **Both halves of the config-file parser fix are present**, and both are required.
  `_parse_env_file` opens the file with `newline=""` *and* splits on `"\n"`. Shipping only the
  split leaves a bare `\r` truncating a value silently, because universal-newline translation
  rewrites it before the split can observe it. Two tests pin the pair, in both directions.
- **Known dual, accepted deliberately:** a CR-only file (classic Mac line endings) parses as one
  line. Unavoidable — translating a lone CR *is* the bug being fixed.
- **A control character between two recipients now fails the email channel loudly** (contained by
  the per-channel guard, with the value not echoed) instead of silently delivering to a subset.
  That is the intended direction.
- Configuration that used to be read from the environment is now passed in. There is no default
  path for the email settings file, the state file or the error log: an unset sink is OFF and says
  so at boot, rather than silently succeeding into a container's disposable layer.
- ⚠️ **A BLANK path is REFUSED at construction; `None` is how you turn a sink off.** This is the
  one migration detail likely to bite, because the obvious port of an environment-driven service
  is `state_file=os.environ.get("ALERT_STATE_FILE", "")` — and a container platform that passes
  every unset optional Variable as an empty string makes that the common case rather than the
  exotic one. A blank behaving like `None` would disable de-duplication silently, so
  `AlertSettings(...)` raises `ValueError` naming the field and what its blank would have cost.
  Port it as `os.environ.get("ALERT_STATE_FILE") or None`.
- `os.PathLike` is accepted for all three path settings, so `pathlib.Path` works everywhere a
  `str` does.
- `read_jsonl_tail(backups=...)` no longer takes `None` as a sentinel meaning "use the module
  default" — `Alerter.read_errors()` passes the settings' value, so the reader and the roller
  cannot disagree. Calling the function directly with `backups=None` raises; see issue #5.
  *(Superseded: 1.4.1 accepts `None` as that sentinel again.)*
