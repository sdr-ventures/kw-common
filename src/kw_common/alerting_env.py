"""The fleet's alerting CONVENTION, executable — the environment layer `alerting` refuses to be.

⭐⭐ WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE, AND WHY IT MUST STAY ONE.

`kw_common.alerting` is deliberately environment-free. v1.0.1 stripped five environment variables
and three default paths out of it, and that removal is what made it portable: it takes an
`AlertSettings` and assumes nothing about where the values came from. Putting file and environment
reading back into it would undo exactly that.

So the deployment knowledge lives HERE, in a sibling, and the split is the design:

    alerting        given settings, deliver a notification. Knows nothing about deployments.
    alerting_env    turn ONE shared file plus THREE variables into those settings.

An app imports both. An app that is not in this deployment — a consumer elsewhere, or a service
that later reads its configuration out of a database — imports only the first, calls
`load_alert_settings(...)` with explicit arguments, or builds an `AlertSettings` by hand.

⭐ THE POINT OF THE PACKAGE: THE CONVENTION IS A FUNCTION SIGNATURE, NOT PROSE.

Container templates in this deployment each declared a different shape of alerting variable, and
not one declared the variable the standard has specified since the alerting redesign. Every new
build re-invented its own configuration because the convention existed only as documentation, and
documentation is interpreted. A missing variable is now an ERROR AT BOOT rather than a silent
divergence discovered when an alert does not arrive.

⛔ NO OPERATOR PATH IS A DEFAULT HERE, IN CODE OR AS A FALLBACK. Not the shared root, not the
config directory, not the environment. All three arrive as values. A default path is one that
silently "works" in the exact deployment it is wrong for, and this library is installed on
machines this file has never seen.

## The three variables

======================  =========  =================================================
variable                mode       purpose
======================  =========  =================================================
``SHARED_ROOT``         read-only  carries ``configs/alerting.env`` and nothing else
``CONFIG_PATH``         read-write the app's OWN directory; holds the validation marker
``DEPLOY_ENV``          --         ``prod`` or ``dev``, case-insensitive
======================  =========  =================================================

⚠️ `CONFIG_PATH` IS NOT THE CONFIG FILE. `load_alert_settings`'s first parameter is called
`config_path` and is the **alerting.env file**; the `CONFIG_PATH` variable is the app's own
**read-write directory** where the marker is written. Two different things wearing one name — the
signature is fixed by the standard, so every function here says which it means, and the marker
parameter is spelled `marker_dir` rather than repeating the ambiguity.

⭐ ONE OPTIONAL VARIABLE OVERRIDES A FILE VALUE: ``SMTP_PROXY``. It is read at boot, and when it is
SET it replaces the shared file's ``SMTP_PROXY`` for this service. Set but empty means a direct
connection even when the file names a proxy. Unset means the file decides, as it always has. Only
the source is logged at boot, never the value.

## The file

    EMAIL_TO EMAIL_FROM SMTP_HOST SMTP_PORT SMTP_USER SMTP_PASSWORD
    NTFY_URL_DEV NTFY_URL_PROD NTFY_URL_<SERVICE>

`DEPLOY_ENV` selects between `NTFY_URL_DEV` and `NTFY_URL_PROD`. A per-service override
`NTFY_URL_<SERVICE>` wins when present — and the choice of key carries a second consequence that
is easy to miss:

⭐ THE TITLE PREFIX IS A PROPERTY OF THE TOPIC, NOT OF THE SERVICE. A service sharing the
environment topic with every other service gets `[<env>][<service>]` in front of its alert titles,
because on a shared topic nothing else says who is talking. A service with its OWN topic gets NO
prefix, because the topic is already the identifier and the prefix would be noise on every push
notification. Getting this backwards is invisible in a test that only checks the URL.

## Failure posture

Everything here is fail-LOUD, which is the opposite of `alerting`'s posture and is correct for
both. `alerting.notify()` never raises: an alerting failure must not take down the thing it is
reporting on. This module runs at BOOT, before anything is running, where a refusal is a startup
crash the operator sees rather than a service that comes up and quietly alerts nobody.

⛔ AND A VALIDATION FAILURE NEVER TRIES TO ALERT. It cannot report a broken alerting channel
*through* that channel; it logs and raises. `AlertEnvError` is the only exception this module
raises on purpose.

    Pure in the sense that matters: it reads NO environment variable and has NO default path.
    Everything it needs is an argument, which is what makes it usable outside this deployment and
    testable without touching `os.environ`.

    `smtp_proxy` is the `SMTP_PROXY` environment value, or `None` when that variable is unset. It
    is passed in rather than read here, for the same reason as every other value above.
    `load_alert_settings_from_env` supplies it. Set (even to `""`) it replaces the file's value,
    and `""` means a direct connection. `None` leaves the file in charge.

    ⭐ `config_values` ARE THE CALLER'S OWN SETTINGS, MERGED OVER THE FILE'S. A service that keeps
    its alert settings in a database passes them here (`{"SMTP_HOST": ..., "SMTP_PASSWORD": ...,
    "NTFY_URL_<SERVICE>": ...}`) instead of writing a file for this package to read. The file is
    still read and still required; a key present here replaces the file's value for that key,
    including with `""`, and a key absent leaves the file's. The merge covers the ntfy keys this
    function reads AND the email keys the send path reads on every notification (they travel in
    the returned settings), and `validate_boot` judges the merged result. Precedence, highest
    first: `smtp_proxy` (for `SMTP_PROXY` only), `config_values`, the file. The values are never
    logged or put in a message; only their key names are.

    ⚠️ `config_path` IS THE alerting.env FILE, not the `CONFIG_PATH` variable (which is the app's
    own read-write directory — see the module docstring; `validate_boot` calls that one
    `marker_dir`).

    What it decides, in order:

    * the environment, normalised — `Prod`, `PROD` and `prod` all produce identical settings;
    * the ntfy topic — the per-service override if the file carries one, else this environment's
      shared topic;
    * the title prefix — EMPTY when the override won, `[<env>][<service>] ` when it did not,
      because the prefix belongs to the topic and not to the service.

    What it deliberately does NOT decide: whether the file is COMPLETE. A missing key leaves the
    corresponding channel unconfigured, which `alerting.warn_if_unconfigured` reports and
    `validate_boot` refuses to boot on. Two responsibilities, two functions — a loader that also
    validated would have to be bypassed by any caller that wanted one without the other.

    ⭐ THE SIZING AND PATH SETTINGS ARE NOT ARGUMENTS HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. `state_file`
    and `error_log` are the app's OWN paths — they live under its read-write volume, not in the
    fleet's shared file — so this loader has nothing to say about them. An adopter that wants them
    writes one stdlib call:

        from dataclasses import replace
        settings = replace(load_alert_settings_from_env("my-service"),
                           state_file="/data/alerts.json",
                           error_log="/data/logs/my-service-errors.log")

    ⭐ `logger_name` IS PASSED THROUGH, and it has to be. It is the one piece of `AlertSettings`
    that this layer cannot leave to `replace()` with a straight face: a service adopting the
    library keeps its OWN logger name precisely so the operator's existing logging configuration
    goes on working, and this loader is the call every app in this deployment makes. A field the
    convention layer cannot set is a field the fleet cannot use. `""` — the default — means the
    library's own logger, so this is inert for every existing caller.

    looked up, and the title prefix that becomes an HTTP header — so "this configuration has
    been validated" was never a fact about the file and the environment alone. Rename the
    service while `CONFIG_PATH`, `DEPLOY_ENV` and the config's bytes stay put and the marker
    still matched, so a refusal a fresh marker directory produces was skipped: the service came
    up with a prefix that fails every ntfy send. The environment fix (`marker_name`) and this
    one are the same defect with `service` in the place of `env`.

    ⭐ IN THE CONTENTS, NOT IN THE FILENAME, and that is the ops-alerting standard's own
    direction rather than a choice made here. The standard fixes the marker's NAME at
    `.alerting-validated-<env>` in `CONFIG_PATH`; it says nothing about how many facts the file
    inside may carry. Line one is still `sha256:<hex>` and nothing else, so anything that reads
    the FIRST LINE reads the digest correctly.

    ⚠️ THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS BACKWARD COMPATIBLE, and the first version of this docstring said
    it was. The only reader that exists is this module's own, and 1.3.0-1.4.1 compared the WHOLE
    stripped text to `sha256:<hex>` — see the comment in `_marker_matches` — so a marker written
    here does not match there. A ROLLBACK therefore costs exactly what the upgrade costs: one
    re-validation and one confirmation alert per service, once. Symmetric and cheap, but a cost
    rather than the absence of one, and it was worth measuring rather than asserting.

    ⚠️ THE NAME IS JSON-ENCODED, WHICH IS NOT DECORATION. `AlertSettings` requires `service` to
    be a non-blank string and strips it; it does NOT refuse control characters the way
    `title_prefix` does, because a service name is not a header value. So a name carrying a
    newline would split into a line this parser could not put back together — and a marker that
    can never match again is the loud failure `_write_marker` documents: re-validate and
    re-announce on EVERY boot, forever. `json.dumps` escapes it to one ASCII line that round
    trips exactly, so the pathological name costs nothing and the ordinary one stays readable

    the digest change itself made: one validation and one confirmation alert per service on the
    first boot after the upgrade, then silence.

    ⛔ THE PAYLOAD MUST OPEN WITH A QUOTE BEFORE `json.loads` SEES IT, and that guard is a
    REFUSAL rather than a shortcut. `json.loads` is a recursive-descent parser: a payload of two
    thousand `[` raises `RecursionError`, which is NOT a `ValueError` — so it walked out of a
    function documented to answer `None` for anything malformed, out of `validate_boot`, which
    is documented to raise `AlertEnvError` and nothing else, past the `except AlertEnvError` the
    setup document tells every adopter to write, and out as a bare traceback at boot. Measured:
    depth 1000 answered `None`, depth 2000 raised, and the threshold moves with whatever stack
    the caller has already used — so it is not a depth to pick a limit against. `_marker_body`
    only ever writes `json.dumps(<str>)`, which always opens with `"`, so nothing this module
    writes is refused by the guard, and nothing that opens with `"` can nest.

    ⚠️⚠️ `RecursionError` IS CAUGHT AS WELL, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN REDUNDANT. An
    earlier version of this docstring declared the two halves mutually redundant; a
    verification pass falsified that, and the correction matters more than the original claim
    did. `json.loads` runs in PYTHON frames, so its recursion check trips as a function of the
    CALLER'S remaining stack rather than of the payload — and with a few frames of headroom the
    perfectly ordinary payload this module itself writes, `service:"feed-poller"`, raises
    inside `json.loads`. Measured on CPython 3.12: at a depth 993 frames into a 997-frame
    budget it answered, at 994 it raised. The quote guard cannot help there — the payload DOES
    open with a quote. So this arm is what keeps a bare traceback out of `validate_boot` for a
    WELL-FORMED marker read by a deep caller, and it has its own tests.

    The quote guard is the half that no test can distinguish today: removing it alone changes
    no observable behaviour, because everything it refuses `json.loads` also refuses. It is
    kept because it answers a different question — is this payload the SHAPE we write — and
    because it makes the pathological case cheap instead of merely survivable. That asymmetry

    ordinary: no `Alerter` installed withholds the marker deliberately, and a refusal raises
    before the write. Asked beforehand, ONE rename in either state accused the operator of a
    shared `CONFIG_PATH` on every boot forever, and the line told them to go and split a
    directory layout that was not the problem. Measured at five boots, five accusations.
    Asked here, the count means what it says: a rename replaces the record once and is silent
    afterwards, a shared directory replaces it on every boot, and a boot that wrote nothing
    says nothing — it has taken nothing from anybody.

    sharing one `CONFIG_PATH` replace each other's record and announce on every boot, and this

    not blind there: `_write_marker` says the marker cannot be read back and that this service
    will re-validate and re-announce on EVERY boot. What is missing is the second service's
    name. Measured, not reasoned about.

    """Verify the alerting configuration at startup. Refuse to boot if it is not usable.

    Returns `True` if this boot validated (and therefore alerted and wrote the marker), `False` if
    it skipped because the marker records the digest of this exact config file. Raises
    `AlertEnvError` on any failure — the caller's `main()` is expected to let that stop the
    process.

    `marker_dir` is the directory the marker is written to, and it must be the app's OWN
    read-write directory — the `CONFIG_PATH` variable. ⚠️ That is a REQUIREMENT ON THE CALLER, not
    something this function can enforce: point it at the shared root and it will try to write
    there, and the shared root is mounted read-only precisely so that fails.

    `shared_root`, when given, is checked to be a directory — that is the "is the mount actually
    there" question, and it is worth asking separately because a missing MOUNT and a missing FILE
    send an operator to different places.

    ⚠️ THIS CHECK IS NOT WHERE MOST CALLERS MEET THAT DISTINCTION, and for a while it was where
    nobody met it. On the sequence the setup document prescribes, `load_alert_settings_from_env`
    reads the config BEFORE this function runs, so a missing mount surfaced from `read_config` as
    an undifferentiated "does not exist" and this refusal never fired — measured both ways by the
    first adopter. That loader now asks the mount question itself, of `SHARED_ROOT`, before the
    read. `read_config` does NOT: it is given a config path and nothing else, and the mount cannot
    be decided from that (see the note there). So the diagnosis arrives when the loader runs first,
    and this check is what answers it for a caller that builds settings some other way and reaches
    validation with a `shared_root` of its own.

    `alerter` is the `Alerter` the success notification goes through; `None` uses the process
    default installed by `alerting.configure()`. With NO alerter available the marker is NOT
    written, so the confirmation is not lost — see `_announce`.

    ⛔ A FAILURE NEVER NOTIFIES. Not once, not "best effort". Every path below that raises has
    logged first and sent nothing: the channel being validated is the one that would carry the
    report, so an attempt to alert about it either goes nowhere or, worse, appears to succeed.

    ⚠️ WHAT THE MARKER CANNOT SEE, stated because a check that implies coverage it lacks is worse
    than none. It records the digest of the CONFIG FILE, so any change to that file re-validates,
    whatever the file's timestamp says (#15). What it does not cover is a change OUTSIDE the file:
    the ntfy endpoint going away, the SMTP password being revoked at the provider, DNS moving. A
    boot check answers "is this configuration well-formed and sendable-looking", never "is the
    remote end still there" — a periodic self-test is what answers that one, and the standard
    requires one of every adopter; this library does not implement it.

    write, changes nothing about what the marker says, and does not re-validate or re-announce.

    ⚠️ THIS WAS WRITTEN AS "THE UPGRADE PATH AND NOTHING ELSE" AND THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE, which
    is worth a sentence rather than a silent edit. It was reached by a marker an earlier release
    wrote at 0644: the digest was right, so it matched, so it skipped. Since #18 a marker written
    before 1.5.0 records no service and matches nothing, so it never gets here — it re-validates,
    and `_write_marker` creates a fresh 0600 file, which closes the same exposure by the other
    door. What is left for this function is a marker THIS release wrote whose mode was widened
    afterwards: a volume restore, an archive unpacked with a permissive umask, a hand-edit. That
    is rarer than the upgrade it was written for and it is not hypothetical, so the repair stays.

    Does nothing at all when the marker is already restricted, which is every boot after the
    first, and on every platform where these bits are not the access-control mechanism.

    ⚠️ ON A FILESYSTEM THAT IGNORES THE MODE this runs on every boot and `_write_marker` warns
    every time. That is the correct outcome rather than a loop worth suppressing: the exposure is
    real and unresolved, and the alternative — remembering the failure — would need state on the
    same volume that cannot hold a permission bit.

# wrong: nothing was announced on that boot, and no later boot re-validates — the marker still
# matches, so the skip keeps firing — while the thing that IS true, that the marker could not be

    ⭐ LINE ONE IS `sha256:<hex>` AND NOTHING ELSE; `_marker_body` builds what goes below it.
    The marker used to be empty and its whole meaning lived in its modification time; it now
    carries the answer itself, so nothing about the ORDER of these two writes matters any
    more. That deleted a real defect rather than a nicety:
    on a one-second-granularity filesystem — an ext4 with 128-byte inodes, which several CI
    runners' scratch disks are — the config and the marker landed on the same second, the marker
    could never be strictly newer, and every boot re-validated and re-alerted forever. Measured
    green on NTFS and red on both Linux jobs at the same commit. A digest has no such failure mode.

    ⛔ THE DIGEST IS A PARAMETER, NOT RE-READ HERE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. An earlier version
    hashed the file at this moment — after the checks and after an SMTP round-trip — so a config
    rewritten during that window was recorded as validated although nothing had looked at it, and
    no later boot re-checked. That reproduced #15's outcome through a narrower door. What is
    recorded must be what was CHECKED; `validate_boot` takes it before anything reads the file.

    ⚠️ AND THE CALLER NOW OWNS THE FORMAT, which the old signature guaranteed by computing it. A
    body not opening with the `sha256:` prefix would be written happily and then match nothing —
    a marker that re-validates and re-announces on EVERY boot, silently, which is precisely the
    failure the deleted `_outrank` existed to prevent. So it is checked here rather than trusted.

    ⚠️ A FAILURE HERE IS NOT A BOOT FAILURE. Refusing to start over a marker would turn a
    missing read-write volume into an outage of the service itself, which is a far worse trade
    than the noise a missing marker costs. ⛔ WHAT that noise IS depends on WHO CALLED, which is
    why the failure message takes `consequence` from the caller rather than asserting one: after
    validation an unwritable `CONFIG_PATH` costs one redundant validation and one duplicate alert
    per boot, while for the upgrade repair it costs nothing at all — the marker still matches, the
    skip keeps working, and the only thing lost is the narrowing. Stating the first for both was a
    message that was false in every clause for one of them.

    ⭐⭐ THE MARKER IS CREATED 0600, AND THE MODE DOES NOT COME FROM A `chmod`. Its content is a
    digest of the shared config, and that file holds `SMTP_PASSWORD` — so a world-readable marker
    inside a shared volume is an OFFLINE VERIFICATION ORACLE: a party who can guess the rest of the
    file can confirm a candidate password against the digest with no rate limit, no SMTP
    connection and no log line anywhere. v1.3.0 introduced that when it gave the marker contents;
    the empty marker it replaced had nothing to leak.

    The write is temp-then-`os.replace`, and the temp is created by `os.open` with mode 0600, for
    two reasons that a `chmod` afterwards does not cover:

    * a `chmod` on a marker some EARLIER version wrote is exactly the call that fails silently on a
      uid-mismatched bind mount. `os.replace` needs only the DIRECTORY to be writable, and this
      directory is `CONFIG_PATH` — the app's own read-write directory, which it must already be
      able to write or there would be no marker at all. So the narrowing cannot half-happen.
    * it is atomic, so a concurrent reader never sees a half-written digest and treats a truncated
      one as a mismatch.

    A umask cannot widen this: `os.open` masks the mode it is given, so the result is always a
    subset of 0600.

    ⛔ AN HMAC INSTEAD OF A DIGEST DOES NOT SOLVE THIS, and the reason is written down so it is not
    re-opened as an improvement. A keyed MAC only helps if the reader cannot obtain the key, and
    every candidate key lives in the same volume as the marker — a key file beside it, a salt
    inside it, or the config's own bytes. A salt defeats precomputation, not guessing. The only
    property that removes the oracle is the marker's own unreadability, which is what this does.

    ⚠️ AND WHERE THE MODE CANNOT BE APPLIED THE MARKER IS STILL KEPT, deliberately. Deleting it
    would fail open into re-validating and re-announcing on EVERY boot, which is the loud wrong
    answer to a quiet problem. It warns instead — and on a filesystem that does not model these
    bits at all (vfat, most CIFS mounts) the marker is not the weak link anyway: `alerting.env`
    itself is equally readable there, and it holds the password in the clear rather than a digest
    of it.
