"""The leak guard must scan the COMMITS being pushed, not just the working tree.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py` scanned `git ls-files` and nothing else. That answers
    "is the leak here NOW", and it has two blind spots that a push turns permanent:

    1. A BRAND-NEW FILE IS NOT TRACKED YET. `git ls-files` lists the index, so a file that has
       not been `git add`ed is not scanned, not reported unreadable, and not counted — it is
       simply absent from the run that prints "no internal info found". Run the guard before
       staging and it clears a tree that does not contain the very file you just wrote. That is
       how a synthetic internal hostname reached a public remote.
    2. A VALUE COMMITTED AND THEN DELETED is absent from the tree too, and stays permanently
       readable at the commit that added it once the branch reaches the remote.

    Both are recoverable only by a history rewrite and a force-push across every clone.

    `test_a_leak_in_a_BRAND_NEW_UNTRACKED_file_...` and
    `test_a_leak_added_then_deleted_...` are the tests that would have caught them. Each
    asserts BOTH halves — the tree scan's blindness AND the range scan closing it — so they
    fail if the range scan is removed and they document why the tree scan alone was never
    enough.

SHAPE
    The diff PARSING is a pure function (`parse_diff`), so most of this runs with no repository
    at all. The tests that build a real repo do so because the claim is about real git history,
    and a synthetic diff would be assuming the thing under test. Those are slow on Windows — a
    commit costs seconds once a virus scanner is watching `.git` — so they carry explicit
    timeouts.

⚠️ EVERY LEAKING LITERAL HERE IS BUILT AT RUNTIME, and every one of them is synthetic
    (`.invalid` is reserved by RFC 2606; the addresses are implausible). Written out whole, they
    would make THIS FILE a finding of the very scanner it tests: the guard skips at most one
    file, its own source, and the working-tree scan runs on every commit.

    ⭐ THAT MATTERS MORE SINCE THE ENGINE WAS EXTRACTED, not less. The guard now runs from an
    INSTALLED package as often as from a checkout, and an installed guard is not inside the
    repository it scans — so it recognises NO file there as its own and skips nothing. A test
    file that spelled a deny case out whole would red the repository it lives in, and there
    would be no self-exemption to fall back on.

    ⭐ THE DENYLIST IS SHAPES ONLY, so there is no longer a real token for this file to avoid
    naming. It used to hold real values — first as plaintext, then base64-encoded — and both
    forms shipped those values in a public repo. They now live in a guard kept in the project
    working directory that is never committed anywhere, and that guard is what runs against the
    staged tree before every push.

    That relocation is why `test_guard_source_carries_no_plaintext_token` is gone: a repository
    that no longer knows the real tokens cannot assert their absence, and a test that pretended
    to would be checking nothing. What CAN be asserted from here is that no real-literal denylist
    has crept back in at all — see `test_the_guard_carries_no_real_literal_denylist` and
    `test_the_denylist_is_the_agreed_shape_set`, which pin the structure rather than the values.

#
# ⛔ WHAT REPLACED `test_guard_source_carries_no_plaintext_token`, AND WHY IT HAD TO GO.
#
# That test decoded the guard's base64 token table and asserted no decoded token appeared in the
# guard's source as a literal. It was the only check that could see past `SELF_PATH`, and it was
# genuinely load-bearing while the guard still carried real values.
#
# It cannot survive the move to a shapes-only denylist, because it depended on the repo knowing
# the real tokens in order to look for them. The whole point of the change is that the repo does
# NOT know them any more: plaintext republished them, and base64 still shipped them one `b64decode`
# away. Keeping a version of that test would mean keeping the values here to test against, which
# is the leak it was written to detect.
#
# So the real-literal assertion moved OUT of this repository, to a guard in the project working
# directory that is never committed and is run against the staged tree before every push. What
# these two tests do instead is pin the STRUCTURE: no encoded table, no decoder, and exactly the
# agreed set of shape patterns. Neither can prove "no real value is present" — nothing inside a

    The tree scan reads the WORKTREE. Stage a leak, overwrite the file with a clean version and do

    honestly, because the worktree really is clean. That is not a defect in the tree scan; it is
    the answer to a different question.

    ⭐ WHAT CHANGED, and why this test did NOT invert. An earlier version of this docstring
    predicted that closing #33 would make the TREE scan exit 1. It did not: the fix was a THIRD
    scan, `--staged`, which asks git what the commit will record, and `.githooks/pre-commit` runs
    both. Making the tree scan read the index instead would have broken the tree scan's own job —
    CI has nothing staged, so it would have had nothing to read.

    All three layers are asserted below, because each covers what the others do not:
      * the tree scan sees the whole tracked tree and says clean here — the premise;
      * `--staged` sees the INDEX and catches it at COMMIT time — the fix for #33;
      * `--range` sees what each commit ADDED and catches it on the PUSH path — the backstop that
        kept this from ever reaching a remote while #33 was open.
