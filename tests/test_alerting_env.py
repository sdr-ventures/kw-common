"""Tests for `kw_common.alerting_env` — the fleet convention, and the two `alerting` changes it
needed.

These travel with the module for the same reason every other suite here does: a behaviour that is
not tested here becomes an untested copy in every consumer the moment it ships. That is not
rhetorical for this package — the whole reason it exists is that a set of container templates each
declared a different shape of alerting variable, every one of them somebody's reasonable reading
of the same prose.

⭐ WHAT THIS FILE IS ADVERSARIAL ABOUT. Three properties are easy to write a test that CANNOT
fail, and each of them is the one that matters:

* **"no default"** — a test that sets a variable and checks the value proves nothing about what
  happens when it is unset. Every convention-layer test here DELETES the variables first.
* **"the prefix is right"** — checking the returned string is half. The prefix has to reach the
  outbound title and NOT reach the de-duplication key, and only one of those is visible in the
  return value.
* **"it refuses"** — a refusal that alerts about itself through the channel it is refusing over
  is not a refusal. Every failure case below asserts the channels recorded NOTHING.

    runs on the SKIP path, and reaching the skip requires `_marker_matches` to have decoded the
    same file to exactly `sha256:<hex>`, which forces it to be pure ASCII. So the composed path
    cannot deliver undecodable bytes to this function, and a test that went in the front door
    silently exercised the validation path instead while asserting a `True` that meant something
    else entirely. The unit is reachable even though the composition is not, and the contract is
    about the unit: nothing in here may raise anything but `AlertEnvError`.
