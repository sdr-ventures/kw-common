"""What the EXTRACTION changed: the guard runs from an installed package, configured from outside.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, separately from the two suites beside it
    `test_leak_guard_range.py` and `test_leak_guard_engine_adds.py` are the ENGINE's tests. They
    travelled here from the repository that owned the engine and they assert what a scan does.
    This file asserts the properties that only exist because the engine is now a PACKAGE:

      * a repository injects its allowances from a file the installer never touches;
      * a configuration that would gut the guard is refused rather than obeyed;
      * the self-exemption follows the guard's own file, so an INSTALLED guard exempts nothing in
        the repository it scans — which is the blind spot the constant fallback used to leave;
      * the four engine-add surfaces still catch what they caught, in that new posture;
      * the module can be imported, invoked as a console script, and carries no repository name it
        should not publish.

⚠️ EVERY LEAKING LITERAL HERE IS ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME, for the reason the sibling suites give and
    one more besides: this file is scanned by the guard in this repository's own CI, and an
    INSTALLED guard recognises nothing here as its own source, so there is no self-exemption to
    fall back on. Every value is synthetic — RFC1918 and CGNAT documentation shapes, `.invalid`
    hosts, `/mnt/<pool>` paths that name no real pool.

⚠️ THE POSTURE UNDER TEST IS "GUARD OUTSIDE THE REPOSITORY". Every subprocess below runs the
    module's own file against a scratch repository it is not inside, which is exactly what
    `site-packages` looks like to a scan. That is not a simulation of the installed case; it is
    the same relationship between the two paths, which is all the self-exemption looks at.

# ⛔⛔ THE `path_exempt` TESTS THAT SAT HERE ARE GONE BECAUSE THE FEATURE IS GONE, and the
# sequence is the point rather than the deletion.
#
# Round 1 of the gate found a complete OFF-SWITCH: the refusal check measured the deny corpus
# with no path, `scan_text` consults the exemption only when a path is given, so
# `{"path_regex": "."}` silenced a pattern tree-wide and was ACCEPTED. The repair measured the
# corpus at a list of ordinary probe paths, and a test here asserted a wide regex was refused
# and a narrow one honoured — both passing.
#
# Round 2 took the repair apart in one pass. The probe list is a nine-name allowlist wearing the
# word "property": `\.go$`, `^internal/`, `^terraform/` and twenty more were accepted and were
# total against a real repository; a negative lookahead over the nine names turned a pattern off
# everywhere in a single line; the narrowest legitimate exemption there is — one named file —
# was REFUSED whenever that file was called `README.md` or `Dockerfile`; and an accepted regex
# was unbounded, `^internal/(a+)+b$` not finishing in two minutes inside a module whose own rule
# is that nothing may hang.
#
# Two designs, both fail-open, one round apart, for a feature NO acceptance criterion asked for —
# what was asked for is an allow-LIST. So it was withdrawn rather than repaired a third time, and
# what remains is pinned instead: a config naming `path_exempt` is REFUSED with a sentence saying
# it was withdrawn (see the malformed-config cases above), and `PATH_EXEMPT` is asserted empty as
# an ENGINE constant that only an edit to the module can change.
#
# `test_the_PROBE_PATH_loop_alone_refuses_a_wide_exemption` went with them: it isolated a loop
