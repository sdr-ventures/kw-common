"""Tests for `kw_common.alerting`.

These travel WITH the module, deliberately. A behaviour that is not tested here becomes six
untested copies the moment it ships — which is the duplication this library exists to end.

Nothing here touches the network or a real SMTP server: the channels are replaced with spies that
RECORD what they were asked, and the assertions read the recording. A spy that answers whatever it
is asked, or a test that asserts only that a call happened, proves nothing.

    """⭐⭐ THE EMAIL SIDE'S MISSING SIBLING, and the claim it enforces is the whole reason the
    userinfo branch exists.

    `test_email_readiness_never_names_the_password` has pinned this for the email channel since
    v1.0.0. The ntfy channel — where the URL IS the capability, and where issue #2's repro A was
    a refusal message printing exactly that — had no counterpart: every ntfy readiness test
    asserted only `is False`. Measured during verification: mutating ANY refusal branch to log
    `self.ntfy_url` survived the entire suite, so the docstring's "NOTHING here echoes the URL"
    was an unverified claim on the exact line that matters most.

    ⭐ ONE URL PER BRANCH, AND THE BRANCHES ARE IDENTIFIED BY SOURCE LINE. Two weaker forms were
    tried and both were measured to fail:

    * **Counting records** does not establish per-branch coverage — two URLs landed on the SAME
      branch and the count was satisfied anyway.
    * **Requiring the messages to be pairwise DISTINCT** does not either, because three of the
      refusal messages interpolate `type(exc).__name__`: two rows can share a branch and still
      render different text. Demonstrated — swapping one row for a non-latin-1 host moved it onto
      the same `except` as another row, the userinfo branch silently stopped being exercised, and
      every assertion here stayed green.

    `LogRecord.lineno` is the branch identity, so a row that drifts onto a neighbour collides and
    fails. That is the difference between a table of branches and a table of hopes.

    ⚠️ ITS ONE LIMIT, stated rather than left to be discovered: `lineno` is the line the `log`
    call sits on, so routing these refusals through a shared helper would collapse them all onto
    the helper's line and this test would report a collision that is not one. No such helper
    exists; if one is ever added, pass `stacklevel=2` so the record keeps naming the caller.

    `_redact` does not backstop this. It operates on channel-FAILURE text; readiness logging
    never passes through it.

    caller's `except` handler instead of logging. Two causes, both fixed —
    `SEVERITIES.get(severity)` was unguarded (`dict.get` propagates whatever the key's own
    `__hash__` raises), and the message was built with an EAGER f-string, which evaluates the
    caller's `__repr__` at the call site before `logging` is ever reached.

    `handleError` and RE-RAISES formatting errors, while the stdlib prints them to stderr and
    returns. Measured — an in-process version of this test fails on THREE of the four hostile
    cases against code that is correct (the unhashable severity passes in-process, because the

    ⚠️⚠️ AND AT `DEBUG`, NOT `CRITICAL`. This probe first ran at `logging.CRITICAL`, where
    `log.error` is below the threshold, so `isEnabledFor` returns False and **no `LogRecord` is
    ever built** — the hostile `__repr__` was never invoked and the test proved only the
    call-site half (no eager f-strings), never reaching logging's formatter at all. Measured:
    at CRITICAL the hostile object's `__repr__`/`__str__` are called 0 and 0 times; at DEBUG,

    while the channel was broken, in the log the README tells an operator to fetch and paste into
    an issue, and in exactly the shape the leak guard's freemail pattern exists to catch.

    Not a credential, which is why the ntfy HOST is still readable; but a personal address
    repeated once per alert is the class the boot dump already masks, and a redaction that holds
    in one place and leaks two lines later is what the issue was filed about.

    The vacuity guard is the point: the address must genuinely be in the exception's text, or the
    absence below is trivially true.

    ⚠️ ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME, like every other deny-shaped literal in this suite. This file is
    scanned by the guard that ships beside it, and a freemail address written out whole is a
    finding of that guard — which is the guard being RIGHT about a public repository, not a false
    positive. Both guards duly caught the first draft of this line. `.invalid` is reserved by
