"""The four surfaces the leak-guard ENGINE was blind to, and the plant-and-measure for each.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py` is the fleet's shared guard: every other repository takes
    a copy of it, so a gap here is a gap everywhere at once. Four were measured against
    `main@046fc7e` (`_sessions/unraid-templates/AUDIT.md`, 2026-08-29), and every one of them
    exited 0 on content that a push would have published permanently:

    ⚠️ HOW THE PROVENANCE IS CITED, AND WHY IT READS ODDLY. `consumer#NN` is an issue in a PRIVATE
    consumer of this library, named in the project audit note above and deliberately not here:
    this file ships inside the sdist attached to every public release, so the fleet's inventory of
    service names would ship with it. It is the SAME spelling `src/kw_common/leakguard.py` uses,
    for the same issues — a second pseudonym for one referent would leave a reader unable to tell
    two issues from one, in the repository whose whole reason for pseudonymising is that guessing
    wrong about which repository an issue lives in is what leaks the estate. `unraid-templates#NN`
    is spelled out because that repository is public. A bare `#NN` below is this repository's own.

      consumer#20   A PATH was read by nothing. A tracked `<rfc1918-addr>.conf`, or a
                   `docs/<host>.lan/` directory, with perfectly clean file CONTENT, passed both
                   scans. A filename is rendered on every GitHub file listing and lands in every
                   clone. (The `<host>.lan-runbook/` spelling is NOT caught and never was — the
                   `.lan` bound rejects a following hyphen. It is pinned as a stated limit by
                   `test_the_path_scan_INHERITS_the_patterns_LIMITS_and_says_so`, which is where
                   the claim and the behaviour are kept in agreement.)
      unraid-templates#39 / consumer#21  The range scan read a commit's IDENTITY
                   (`%an%ae%cn%ce`) and its DIFF, and nothing else. A leak written into a commit
                   MESSAGE — or into an annotated tag's name, tagger or message — was published
                   and reported clean.
      unraid-templates#33 / consumer#23  The pre-commit layer read the WORKTREE. `git add` a leak,
                   tidy the worktree without re-staging, and the hook exits 0 while the commit
                   records the leak.
      consumer#22   `SKIP_SUFFIXES` was trusted outright, so an ASCII runbook named `.pdf` was read
                   by neither scan; and a run that scanned ZERO files printed the same cheerful
                   "no internal info found" a real clean run prints.

    The tests below fall into TWO kinds, and only the first is a reproduction:

      * the CATCH tests — each is one of the gaps above, committed. Each FAILS against the engine
        as it was and PASSES against the engine as it is, which is what makes it the anti-rot
        check for its issue: if a future edit reopens the gap, this is what says so.
      * the FALSE-RED tests — `test_an_ordinary_or_allow_listed_path_is_not_a_finding`,
        `test_an_ORDINARY_commit_message_does_not_block_a_push`, `test_a_tag_THIS_PUSH_DOES_NOT_
        SEND_is_NOT_scanned`, `test_the_floor_does_not_*`, and the control halves generally. These
        pass against BOTH engines by construction — the old one scanned neither surface, so it
        could not false-red on it. They are not reproductions of the four gaps; they are the
        regression tests for the SECOND round of defects, where the fixes above reddened trees
        that leak nothing (a machine-local override filename, a message naming one, a scratch tag,
        an `rm` of a tracked image, an empty repository). Saying so matters because "every test
        here fails against the old engine" is the kind of claim this file exists to keep out.

⚠️ EVERY LEAKING LITERAL HERE IS ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME, exactly as in
    `test_leak_guard_range.py`, and every one is synthetic. This file is scanned by the guard —
    only `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py` is exempt — so a deny case written out whole would
    make the guard fail on its own test suite.

⚠️ EVERY `git` CALL PINS ITS CONFIG. A test that inherits the machine's git config is the
    config-dependent sibling of a time-bomb test: the CI runner has no `user.email`, so a
    `git commit` that needs one silently no-ops there and a test whose SETUP no-ops passes
    VACUOUSLY while looking like coverage. Identity, signing and autocrlf are all pinned, and the
    plants are re-read from git before anything is asserted about them.

    A ref NAME is published, and nothing scans one. `git push origin clean:refs/tags/<host>.lan`
    puts a leaking name on a remote with the guard reporting clean.

    ⛔ THIS IS A REVERT, NOT AN OVERSIGHT — issue #49. Ref-name scanning was built and then
    withdrawn after producing a production bypass in three consecutive verification rounds: first
    a local-vs-remote ref confusion, then — once that was closed — `<host>.lan-deploy` (one
    trailing hyphen), a UUID-named ref and a `.local`-named ref all still published clean, while
    the LOCAL name produced a false red whose printed remedy was inert against it. An addition
    that cannot converge inside a package does not get to hold it.

    ⭐ DRIVEN THROUGH THE ENGINE, NOT THROUGH A HOOK. The original version of this test installed
    this repository's `.githooks` into a scratch repository and pushed. That measured the gap AND
    the wiring at once, which was right while the guard lived in the repository it protected — a
    packaged engine has no hooks of its own, and a library that invented some so a copied test
    could pass would be building a feature to satisfy a test. What travels is the ENGINE claim:
    the refs a push publishes are read for their tag OBJECTS, and a ref NAME is not read as a name.

    Pinned in BOTH directions so the revert stays deliberate: the gap is real, and an ordinary
    range scan is not reddened by any leftover of the withdrawn machinery. If someone closes #49,
    the gap assertion inverts and this docstring is what tells them why it was ever here.

    ⚠️ THE GAP IS NARROWER THAN "REF NAMES", and measuring it is what showed that. An ANNOTATED
    tag's name IS caught — not by a name scan, but because `tag <name>` is a line of the tag
    OBJECT, which is read in full. Both directions are asserted below so the boundary is a
    measured fact rather than a summary: the name inside an object is covered, and a BRANCH name
