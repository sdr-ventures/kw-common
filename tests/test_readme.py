"""The README's quick-start must actually work.

⭐ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The README's Python example is the ONLY adoption example in the
repository, and it shipped calling `warn_if_unconfigured(...)` without importing it — a
`NameError` on the third line, in the call that exists to stop alerts silently going nowhere. It
was written, reviewed and committed without once being run.

⚠️ IT IS CHECKED, NOT EXECUTED, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Running the snippet verbatim does real
work: it resolves a hostname, and it creates the directories its example paths name — measured,
running it once created a `my-service` tree on the machine. A test that has to be cleaned up
after is a test that will eventually not be. So this resolves every name the snippet uses against
what the snippet imports plus the builtins, which is precisely the defect class that got through,
with no side effects at all.
