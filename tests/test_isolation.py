"""The generic-code contract, enforced as tests rather than as a promise — FOR EVERY MODULE.

A module in this library earns its place by satisfying rules a reviewer cannot reliably eyeball.
These are the ones a green functional suite says NOTHING about:

1. **It imports cleanly in isolation.** Copy the module alone into an empty directory and import
   it: no consumer module, and no other `kw_common` module beyond the one dependency edge the
   contract allows, may appear in `sys.modules`.
2. **Configuration is INJECTED, never assumed.** The module names no environment variable, no
   default path and no service name — the caller passes what it uses. This is checked against the
   AST rather than the text, so an explanatory comment cannot fail it and a real `os.environ`
   read cannot hide behind one. `alerting_env` is the deliberate exception, and its reads are
   pinned to exactly the three variables the standard names.
3. **Stdlib-first**, 5. **independently importable** and 7. **an explicit `__all__`** — each
   asked of every module below.

⭐⭐ PARAMETRISED OVER `src/kw_common/*.py` (#12). This file used to bind a single `MODULE_PATH`
— `alerting.py` — so every one of its checks measured that module and no other, while
`README.md` said the contract was enforced for all of them. `leakguard` arrived in v1.1.0 with
none of this cover, and module four would have arrived the same way. Now a module is held to the
contract the day it is added rather than the day somebody remembers.
