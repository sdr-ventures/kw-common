"""The pre-push hook: what it DOES, driven end to end against a real `git push`.

⭐ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY CANNOT SAY (#16, #10).

`test_the_shipped_guard_names_no_private_repository` used to live in
`tests/test_leak_guard_extraction.py`. It asked ONE file — the guard's own source — whether it
named a private repository, and it carried the list of those names as a plain tuple. Both halves
were wrong:

  * every OTHER published file was unchecked. Four private service names reached the template, the
    setup document, the CHANGELOG and a module during 1.2.0 and were caught by a person reading,
    not by any check. `MANIFEST.in` puts `tests/`, `docs/` and the template in the sdist attached
    to every public Release, and the modules are in the wheel.
  * the LIST ITSELF SHIPPED. The inventory the check existed to keep out of published artifacts
    was published inside the check, and had been since 1.1.0. Widening that test's reach while
    the list stayed would have made the disclosure worse, not better; hashing or splitting it
    in-repo is the same disclosure with extra steps.

So the list moved OUT, into a guard that is committed to nothing, and the check moved from a
pytest assertion to `.githooks/pre-push`. That is a real trade and this file states it rather than
implying coverage it does not have:

  ⚠️ CI CANNOT VERIFY A LIST IT MUST NOT HAVE. Nothing here — and nothing in CI — can assert that
     the hook RAN on somebody's machine, or that the names are absent from this tree. What this
     file asserts is that the hook exists, is installed the way it says it is, and REFUSES the
     push when the guard it delegates to finds something. The other half is a local preflight and
     is honest about being one.

⭐ EVERY END-TO-END TEST BELOW DRIVES A REAL `git push` TO A REAL BARE REMOTE, and asserts what
HAPPENED — the remote ref moved, or it did not. A wiring assertion ("`--public-repo` appears in
the hook file") holds while the hook is unreachable, while the interpreter probe fails, and while
the exit code is discarded; #10 names that shape explicitly as the thing not to write.

The guard the hook calls is STUBBED here. It has to be: the real one is not in this repository,
which is the entire point of #16. The stub takes the same command line and records the arguments
it was handed, so the `--not --remotes` case — the brand-new branch that would otherwise scan zero
commits — is pinned by what the hook actually passed.

# It also APPENDS its argv to a log the tests read, which is how the range form is asserted.
#
# ⭐ IT HONOURS `--public-repo` RATHER THAN IGNORING IT, and that is not decoration. The real
# guard's private-name class is OFF unless that flag is passed — a sibling's own name is ordinary
# content in its own private repository — so a hook that dropped the flag would run a scan that
# structurally cannot see the thing it exists to catch, and report clean. A stub that treats the
# flag as noise turns every assertion about it into a wiring assertion; this one makes dropping it
# change the OUTCOME.
#
# ⛔ AND IT READS NO STDIN, which is a requirement the hook's own header states. A guard that read
# stdin would consume git's ref list and the commit scan would silently not run.
